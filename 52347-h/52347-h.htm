<h2>PREFATORY.</h2>


<p>A joint resolution of the Legislature of Pennsylvania was
passed on the 7th day of March, 1867, inviting Hon. <span class="smcap">James
Ross Snowden</span> to deliver, in the Hall of the House of Representatives,
his historical address on <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and the
Six Nations of Indians.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this resolution, on the 14th of March, the members
of both Houses, and a number of citizens, being convened,
Hon. <span class="smcap">John P. Glass</span>, Speaker of the House of Representatives,
was called to the chair; and <span class="smcap">Geo. W. Hamersly</span>, Esq.,
Clerk of the Senate, <span class="smcap">A. W. Benedict</span>, Esq., Clerk of the House
of Representatives, and <span class="smcap">John A. Smull</span>, Esq., Resident Clerk
of the House of Representatives, were appointed Secretaries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Snowden</span> was introduced to the audience by Mr. Speaker
<span class="smcap">Glass</span>, with some appropriate remarks.</p>

<p>Previous to the delivery of the historical sketch, Mr. <span class="smcap">Snowden</span>
made the following introductory remarks:</p>

<p>At the last session of the Legislature a joint resolution was
adopted, appropriating a sum of money for the erection of a
monument to the memory of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, the celebrated
Chief of the Seneca Nation of Indians. The same resolution
placed the subject in charge of the Hon. <span class="smcap">Samuel P. Johnson</span>,
President Judge of the Sixth Judicial District. Under his
direction, an appropriate monument was prepared and placed
in position over the grave of the Chief, at Jennesadaga, (Cornplanter's
village,) in the county of Warren, on the Allegheny
river, fifteen miles above the borough of Warren. I was selected,
by Judge <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, to deliver an address upon the occasion.
This duty I performed. The monument was dedicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
with appropriate exercises, on the 18th of October last. There
were present about four hundred Indians, and a large concourse
of citizens of Pennsylvania and New York.</p>

<p>I have, at hand, the report of Judge <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, to the Legislature,
showing the manner in which he has discharged the
duties assigned him. His report embraces his introductory
remarks and the historical sketch which I delivered. Also,
the responses made by a Chief of the Six Nations, and a councillor
of the Seneca Nation. The responses were made in the
Indian language. They were reported, and taken down by me
as they were translated by an interpreter at the time of delivery.</p>

<p>I have here, also, a photograph of the monument and the
audience, taken during the delivery of the historical address.
This report, with the accompanying papers, will be presented
to the Legislature. I am here, this evening, at the request of
the Senate and House of Representatives, to deliver the historical
and biographical sketch which I pronounced at the grave
of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, when the monument, erected to his memory,
was dedicated. For the honor of this invitation, I beg to present
to the members of the Legislature my sincere thanks.</p>

<p>After Mr. <span class="smcap">Snowden</span> had concluded his address, the following
resolutions, offered by Senator <span class="smcap">M. B. Lowry</span>, of Erie, and
seconded by Senator <span class="smcap">Thomas J. Bigham</span>, of Allegheny, were
unanimously adopted:</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the members of the House of Representatives,
jointly assembled, hereby tender our thanks to the Hon. <span class="smcap">James
Ross Snowden</span>, for his excellent and carefully prepared historical
address, prepared for and delivered on the occasion of
the dedication of the <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> monument, and which
we have heard repeated with lively interest and satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Resolved further</i>, That the thanks of the members of both
Houses is also tendered to Hon. <span class="smcap">Samuel P. Johnson</span>, for the
judicious and admirable manner in which he has discharged
the duty assigned him, by the last Legislature, in causing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
be erected an appropriate and suitable monument over the
grave of the Seneca Chief.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That copies of these resolutions be furnished to
Colonel <span class="smcap">Snowden</span> and Judge <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>: and that the same be
prefixed to the publication of the <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> memorial.</p>

<p class="caption3"><i>To the Senate and House of Representatives
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania:</i></p>

<p>At the last session of the Legislature a joint resolution was
passed by your honorable bodies, appropriating five hundred
dollars, for the erection of a monument to the memory of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
an Indian Chief of the Seneca tribe, whose remains
were deposited at Jennesadaga, where he had resided, in the
county of Warren. By said resolution, I was appointed to superintend
the execution of this generous purpose.</p>

<p>This duty might have been committed to more competent,
but not more willing hands. My personal relations with the
venerated chieftain in his life-time, had left a vivid recollection
of his virtues that the abrasion of more than thirty years could
not obliterate.</p>

<p>In discharge of the duty thus imposed, I procured a monument
of marble, to be erected by Mr. <span class="smcap">W. H. Fullerton</span>, of
South Dorset, Vermont. In size, design and workmanship, it
more than met my expectation, and was very creditable to the
artificer. The monument itself, of beautiful Vermont marble,
is over eleven feet high, and stands on a handsomely cut native
stone base, four feet in diameter, by one and a-half feet
deep. It is located immediately between the grave of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
and that of his wife, from whom he was separated
by death but about three months. On the second section are
four well carved dies, in the form of a shield. Upon the spire
facing west, is cut in large raised letters:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span></p>

<p class="center">"GIANTWAHIA, THE CORNPLANTER."</p>

<p>Upon the die on the same side, is inscribed,</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">John O'Bail</span> <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, <i>died at</i><br />
<i>Cornplanter town, February 18, 1836, aged about 100 years.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>On the die fronting south, the following inscription is handsomely
lettered:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>"Chief of the Seneca tribe, and a principal Chief of the<br />
Six Nations, from the period of the Revolutionary<br />
war, to the time of his death. Distinguished for<br />
talents, courage, eloquence, sobriety and love of<br />
his tribe and race, to whose welfare he devoted<br />
his time, his energies and his means,<br />
during a long and eventful life."</i><br />
</p>

<p>On the die upon the East side is engraved:</p>

<p class="center">
"ERECTED BY AUTHORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE OF PENNSYLVANIA,<br />
BY ACT JANUARY 25, 1866."<br />
</p>

<p>Desiring to make the munificence of the State as gratifying
to the family and friends of the good old Chief as possible, I
appointed a time for the erection and dedication of the monument,
and was fortunate enough to procure the services of Col.
<span class="smcap">James Ross Snowden</span>, of Philadelphia, to prepare an address
suitable to the occasion, commemorative of the character and
services of the distinguished Chief.</p>

<p>These ceremonies took place on the 18th of October last, in
presence of the family and descendants of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, about
eighty in number, and a large assembly of native Indians,
remnants of the once formidable Six Nations, from the Allegheny,
Cattaraugus and Tonnawanda reservations in the State
of New York, and also a large concourse of the pale faces
from the surrounding country. Everything went off most satisfactorily,
and to the high gratification of our aboriginal friends.
The exercises of the day were conducted according to the following
programme:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span></p>

<p>1. Invocatory prayer by the Chaplain.</p>

<p>2. Introductory address by your representative, as master
of ceremonies.</p>

<p>3. Dedicatory address, by Hon. <span class="smcap">James Ross Snowden</span>.</p>

<p>4. Address on the personal character of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and
the lessons it taught, by Rev. <span class="smcap">W. A. Rankin</span>.</p>

<p>5. Responsive addresses, in the Seneca language, by <span class="smcap">John
Luke</span>, of the Cattaraugus reservation, a Councillor of the
Seneca Nations, and by the Rev. <span class="smcap">Stephen S. Smith</span>, a native
of the Tonnawanda reservation, Gennessee county, N. Y., also
a Seneca chief of the Six Nations.</p>

<p>These two latter addresses, as also those made by the Rev.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span> and myself, were interpreted, as delivered, by <span class="smcap">Harrison
Halftown</span> and another educated native of the Seneca
nation. Before the dedicatory services commenced, the assembly
was addressed in the Seneca language, by <span class="smcap">Solomon O'Bail</span>,
a grandson of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and a chief of his tribe, dressed
in the full regalia of aboriginal royalty.</p>

<p>Three of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> children still survive, and were
present to enjoy the occasion; and, by them, I was solemnly
charged to communicate to your honorable bodies, their sincere
and reiterated thanks for the distinguished honor thus
rendered to their beloved ancestor. I have seldom seen deeper
gratitude in human hearts than swelled the bosoms of these
now venerable children, and those of many grand-children of
the hero, whose virtues and memory it has delighted you to
honor.</p>

<p>Of the excellent music, by a native brass band, that enlivened
the occasion, the pic-nic that followed, and the exciting
war dance, that closed the exercises of the day, I will not stop
to speak.</p>

<p>There remains yet in my hands, unexpended, about $45 of the
appropriation made. The lateness of the season, the paucity
of funds and the pressure of other engagements, combined to
prevent the erection of such an enclosure around the monument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span>
as which Legislature evidently contemplated, and as would
be suitable for its permanent protection.</p>

<p>To construct such a fence, of imperishable material, as ought
to surround this memorial of State gratitude, to a public benefactor,
will require at least $100, judiciously expended. I
think it is due to the credit of the State, as it would be highly
pleasing to the heirs and friends of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, that a
small additional appropriation should be made to consistently
complete the work so generously begun. I am willing to bestow
my time and attention, gratuitously, to accomplish it. I
append to this report, the introductory remarks made at the
dedication ceremonies, and the excellent address delivered by
Col. <span class="smcap">Snowden</span>, together with brief sketches of the responses
made by the native orators who graced the occasion, that you
may make such a disposition of them as, in your judgment,
may be creditable to the State and beneficial to posterity.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY_REMARKS" id="INTRODUCTORY_REMARKS">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS</a><br />

OF<br />

HON. S. P. JOHNSON.</h2>



<p><i>Friends of Cornplanter and fellow citizens:</i></p>

<p>By a joint resolution of the Pennsylvania Legislature, approved
by the Governor the 25th of January, 1866, the State
Treasurer was directed to pay to me, the sum of five hundred
dollars, "to be expended in erecting and enclosing a suitable
monument to <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, as a recognition of his eminent
services to the State during its early history."</p>

<p>This duty I have endeavored to perform, as well as the limited
means at my disposal would permit. You have before
you to-day, the result of that effort, which, for the price paid,
is highly creditable to the State, the Chieftain, whose virtues
it is intended to commemorate, and the architect who designed
and executed it. It is befitting that the virtues and services
of public benefactors should receive public recognition
and be perpetuated by suitable memorials. There is much in
the history of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, after his alliance with the American
government, to elicit admiration and secure the gratitude
of this State and the nation.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the close of the Revolutionary war he became
the fast friend of the white man and the government.
Satisfied that his nation had been fraudulently decoyed into
alliance with the British during the war, and basely betrayed
by then allies at its close, he hastened to repair the wrong, by
giving all his influence and energies to the inauguration of a
peace between the United States and the Six Nations, of which
he was then a distinguished Chief. Although resisted by all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span>
the craftiness of <span class="smcap">Brant</span>, and the eloquence of <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>,
he persisted until his purpose was consummated by the treaties
of Fort Stanwix and Fort Harmar, both of which were
secured through and executed by himself. By them the Indian
claims to most of the land in Western New York, and
North-Western Pennsylvania, was surrendered, and a perpetual
peace ordained.</p>

<p>But the great merit of his life, and which most entitled him
to the gratitude of the American government, and the State
of Pennsylvania, was his successful efforts to prevent the Six
Nations uniting in the Confederacy of western Indians formed
in 1790-91. Had these tribes, then the most powerful on the
continent, joined that Confederacy, the bloody realities of the
war that followed, would have spread over the entire western
frontier of Pennsylvania, and its termination in 1794, by the
victory of General <span class="smcap">Wayne</span>, rendered exceedingly doubtful.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">St. Clair</span> anticipated and forwarned against this
union, after his defeat in '91, and General <span class="smcap">Knox</span>, then Secretary
of War, dreaded and fortified against it. But <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
with untiring exertions, and at the hazard of his
own life, prevented such a disastrous result, and thus saved
the settlers on the Allegheny and upper Ohio, from the horrors
of a merciless Indian warfare. For his invaluable services
in the procurement and maintenance of peace between
his people and the infant nation, just recuperating from its exhausting
conflict with the British lion, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> received
the thanks and liberal donations of the government and General
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>.</p>

<p>We are now assembled upon the homestead which <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
lived, and where, after an eventful life, during the
most eventful period of this continent, he lived and died, at
peace with himself, with all the world, and, we trust, with his
Merciful Creator. For many years, the appearance of his venerable
form, at any point in the Valley of this beautiful river,
from its source to its outlet, was the signal for a courteous and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> 17 </a></span>
kindly greeting by all who knew him. His visitors, whether
on business or for curiosity, were always treated with a dignified
kindness and hospitality that would have graced the castle
of a Duke, in the days of chivalry.</p>

<p>On this beautiful spot, of his own selection, the gift of a
grateful Commonwealth for appreciated merit, he spent the
last forty-five years of his life, surrounded by his family and
descendants, in the practice of all those virtues that adorn both
civilized and savage life.</p>

<p>He was the dauntless warrior and wisest statesman of his
nation, the patriarch of his tribe and the peacemaker of his
race. He was a model man from nature's mould. Truth, temperance,
justice and humanity, never had a nobler incarnation
or more earnest and consistent advocate than he. As we loved
him personally, and revere the noble, manly character he bore,
we erect this tribute to his memory, that those who live after
us may know and imitate his virtues.</p>

<p class="caption4">The last War Chief of the Senecas, and of the Iroquois, or Six Nations.</p>

<p class="caption3">AN HISTORICAL SKETCH BY</p>

<p class="caption2">JAMES ROSS SNOWDEN.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>A solitary traveler, after the close of the Revolutionary
war, in 1783, wandering near the shores of Chatanque
lake,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> found himself benighted; and ignorant of the path
which should lead him to his place of destination, he feared
he would be compelled to pass the night in the forest
and without shelter. But when the darkness of the
night gathered around him, he saw the light of a distant
fire in the woods, to which he immediately bent his steps.
There he found an Indian wigwam, the habitation of a
Chief with his family. He was kindly received and hospitably
entertained. After a supper of corn and venison,
the traveler returned thanks to God, whose kind
Providence had directed his way, and preserved him in
the wilderness. He slept comfortably on the ample
bear skins provided by his host.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Cha-da-gweh, by the Senecas; meaning a place where one was lost.</p></div>

<p>In the morning the Indian invited the traveler to sit
beside him on a large log in front of his cabin. They
were seated side by side; presently the Indian told the
traveler to move a little; which he did; and, keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span>
by his side, again requested him to move. This was repeated
several times. At length, when near the end of
the log, the Chief gave an energetic push, and requested
his companion to move further. The traveler remonstrated,
and said, "I can go no further; if I do I shall
fall off the log." "That is the way," said the Indian, in
reply, "that you white people treat us. When the
United People, the Six Nations, owned the whole land,
from the lakes to the great water, they gave to <span class="smcap">Corlaer</span><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
a seat on the Hudson, and to <span class="smcap">Onas</span><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> a town and land
on the Delaware. We have been driven from our lands
on the Mohawk, the Gennessee, the Chemung and the
Unadilla. And from our western door we have been
pushed, from the Susquehanna, then over the great mountains,
then beyond the Ohio, the Allegheny and the Conewango;
and now we are here on the borders of the
great lakes, and a further push will throw me and my
people off the log. If I ask, where is our land? a bird
whispers in my ear, the Great King over the water has
made peace with <span class="smcap">Washington</span> and the thirteen fires,
and divided the land between them by a line through
the great lakes. Our Chiefs were not at the council, we
were not warmed by its fire, nor protected by its heat.
Our ally, in his hurry to make peace, forgot his red
brethren; and did not even invite them to smoke the
calamut which he had prepared for the thirteen fires
which had rebelled against him." The Chief, in conclusion,
with a sad and anxious countenance, asked the
question, "Where are we to go?" The only response
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> 23 </a></span>
that was made was the sighing of the wind through the
leaves of the forest. The traveler was silent.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> The Indian name of <span class="smcap">William Penn</span>; and subsequently applied to the
Governors of Pennsylvania.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Rev. <span class="smcap">Samuel Kirtland</span>, missionary among the Indians, was the
traveler referred to. He stated the substance of this anecdote to my
father, Rev. <span class="smcap">Nathaniel R. Snowden</span>.</p></div>

<p>I have seen a large medal of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, on one side
of which is his bust in armor facing to the right. On
the reverse or opposite side, is a full length figure of an
Indian chief looking to the left, with an arrow in his
right hand, and leaning on a bow; it contains the inscription
"<i>The land was ours.</i>" It also inscribes to
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> these words: "<i>Innumerable millions yet
unborn will venerate the memory of the man who obtained
their country's freedom.</i>" Both these inscriptions command
our assent. It thus appears that what was partial
evil to the red man may be regarded as universal good to
the human race. The former gives way to the advancing
column of civilization, and will disappear from the
land unless he abandons the life of a wanderer, and acquires
a fixed home, where he can cultivate the soil and
pursue the arts of civilized industry.</p>

<p>It would be inappropriate to this occasion, to enter
upon a discussion of the causes of the gradual disappearance
of the Indian race, when coming in contact
with white men, nor of the tendency of the intercourse
between these races of men to deteriorate the former and
reduce their numbers. Neither can I enter upon the
ethics involved in such a discussion. I leave these topics
to the moral philosopher and the historian.</p>

<p>The distinguished Chief whose memory we this day
commemorate, met these questions as practical facts.
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> had learned from observation as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span>
experience, the influence and power of the whites, and
as an able statesmen and friend of his race, he yielded
to the superior force, and endeavored to preserve the
existence of his family and nation, by securing for his
people, land and other property where they would not
be disturbed by the encroachment of the whites. It is
a noticeable fact, and highly illustrative of his far-seeing
policy, that in the treaties in which he took part as a
Chief or representative of his tribe, he declined to stipulate
for, or receive money or goods, but asked for well
defined boundaries to their territories, or for land by title
in fee simple to himself and to his people. He had the
sagacity to perceive that if his nation and people depended
upon a mere hunter's right to roam over a section
of country, they would be driven, like other Indian
tribes, from place to place, and at length be either exterminated
or removed to distant lands, where they would
be regarded as new comers, and be oppressed or destroyed
by the Indians who had a prior claim to the territory.</p>

<p>Before making further remarks upon the life, character
and public services of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, I deem it proper
to present some general observations respecting the
Indian League or Confederacy,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> known originally as the
Five Nations, called by the French, Iroquois, and afterwards
as the Six Nations, of which the tribe of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Senecas</span>,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> was the most numerous and powerful.
The Confederacy was originally composed of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span>
Senecas, Oneidas, Mohawks, Onondagos and Cayugas.
To these were added in the year 1712, the Tuscaroras,
who had previously resided, and had their hunting ground
in North Carolina, but in that year were driven north by
the southern Indians, and were added to the League,
thence afterwards called the Six Nations. In many authorities
and manuscripts, however, they continued to
be denominated the Five Nations.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Ho-de-no-sau-nee, or the United People.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> The original name of this tribe was Nun-da-wa-o-no, which means Great
Hill People. The modern name is a corruption of a Dutch word for vermillion,
<i>Sinnekar</i>; and has reference to the fact, that this tribe, being the
most warlike of the Six Nations, used the war paint more than the others.</p></div>

<p>The power and influence of this Confederacy of nations,
or Iroquois, at the time when the emigrants from Europe
set their feet upon the extensive country, now embraced
in the States of New York and Pennsylvania, and the
extensive region beyond the Ohio, even to the Mississippi,
were greats and overshadowed, if they did not
actually control and govern, all other tribes of Indians
within what is at the present time a large portion of the
United States.</p>

<p>Their power even extended to the New England colonies
and to Virginia. In 1684 the Governors of New
York, Massachusetts and Virginia, met in council with
the representative Chiefs of the Five Nations at Albany,
"to strengthen and burnish," so says the treaty, "the
covenant chain, and plant the tree of peace, of which
the top should reach the sun, and the branches shelter
the wide land." This treaty related not only to the territory
in the actual possession of the Iroquois&mdash;called
by them "The Long House," but embraced the extensive
country from the St. Croix to the Albemarle. It
may be interesting here, in order to illustrate the extent
of their claims and authority, to quote a few words from
the journal of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Mason</span> and <span class="smcap">Dixon</span>, when running
their famous line. One of the original manuscript copies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26 </a></span>
of which is in possession of the Historical Society of
Pennsylvania. It is understood that there were three
copies, in manuscript, prepared by these celebrated surveyors.
I quote the following entries from the manuscript
journal: "July 16, 1767. This day we were joined
by fourteen Indians, deputed by the Chief of the Six
Nations, to go with us on the line. With them came
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hugh Crawford</span>, interpreter," "October 9, 1767.&mdash;Crossed
a war path near Dunkard creek. This day the
Chief of the Indians, which joined us on the 16th July,
informed us that the above mentioned war path was the
extent of his commission from the Chief of the Six Nations,
that he should go with us with the line; and that
<i>he would not proceed one step farther</i>."</p>

<p>Their principal seats, however, were in Western New
York and North-western Pennsylvania. They were thus
situated between the advancing column of emigration and
settlements of the English from the Hudson, the Delaware,
the Susquehanna and the Potomac on the one hand, and
the French from Canada, the St. Lawrence, and the great
lakes on the other. A territorial position, alike perilous to
their aboriginal habits, customs and means of subsistence,
as to their existence as a free and independent nation.
And yet, notwithstanding these adverse circumstances,
they stood for nearly two centuries, with an unshaken
front, against the devastations of war, the blighting influence
of foreign intercourse, and the still more fatal
encroachments of a restless and advancing border population.
United under their federal system, they maintained
their independence and their power of self-protection
long after the New England and Virginia races
had surrendered their jurisdiction and fallen into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27 </a></span>
condition of conquered and dependent nations. And
they now stand forth upon the canvas of Indian history
prominent alike for the wisdom of their civil institutions,
their sagacity in the administration of the affairs of the
League and their courage in its defence. (<span class="smcap">Morgan's</span>
League of the Iroquois.)</p>

<p>Their system of government was remarkable for its
simplicity and strength. The separate tribes, though
united in one council fire, which was usually kindled
and kept burning at Onondago, were, to some extent,
sovereign and independent. In fact, their government
was somewhat similar in structure to that which
is established in the United States. Several republics
were embraced in one. There were Chiefs for each
tribe. Hereditary to a qualified extent, but dependent
upon a ceremony of confirmation or investiture.
Sometimes merit and public confidence would induce
this investiture, without regard to hereditary right.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">William Johnston</span> states, "that the Sachems of
each tribe of the Six Nations were annually chosen in a
public assembly of the Chiefs and Warriors, whenever a
vacancy happened by death or otherwise. They were
selected from among the oldest Warriors, for their sense
and bravery, and approved of by all the tribe, after
which they were selected as Sachems. Military services
were the chief recommendations to this rank; but in
some instances, a kind of inheritance in the office was
recognized." I think there was a distinction between the
<i>Sachems</i> and the <i>Chiefs</i>. The former had the direction
of civil affairs and government, and the latter led the
tribes in war. The rank of Sachem was in general hereditary,
whilst that of Chief was conferred on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> 28 </a></span>
of ability, and especially bravery in war. A certain
number of Chiefs were assigned to the different tribes.
These Chiefs formed the council of the League, and in
them was lodged the executive, legislative and judicial
authority, for the general purposes of the united nations.
As illustrative of the character of their government, I
here insert the address of the Six Nations, to the colonies
of Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland, delivered
at the treaty made in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1744.
"We heartily recommend union and agreement between
you, our brethren. Never disagree, but preserve a strict
friendship for one another, and thereby you, as well as
we, will become the stronger. Our wise forefathers established
amity and friendship among the Five Nations.
This has made us formidable, and has given us weight
and authority with the neighboring nations. We are a
powerful Confederacy, and by your observing the same
means which our wise forefathers pursued, you will acquire
fresh strength and power. Therefore whatever befalls
you, never fall out with one another."</p>

<p>These are memorable words, and indicate the complacency
of the members of the Confederacy with their
own condition and power. Feeling secure in their castles
beyond the mountains, and contented with their
homes, amidst their beautiful lakes, and rivers and forests,
where they possessed towns and villages, cultivated
fields and orchards of various fruits, and being kindly
disposed to their white brethren of the English colonies,
they ventured the friendly task of giving them such wise
and excellent counsel and advice, as is worthy of being
re-produced on this occasion, although one hundred and
twenty-two years have passed away since its delivery on
the banks of the Conestoga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> 29 </a></span></p>

<p>Governor <span class="smcap">De Witt Clinton</span>, in his address before the
Historical Society of New York, December 6, 1811,
quotes the foregoing address, and says: "This ancient
and cementing principle of union and fraternity, which
has connected them in friendship, and which was the
basis of their power, and the pillar of their greatness,
has been entirely driven from them. Party, in all its
forms and violence, rages among them with uncontrolled
sway. The nations are split up into fragments; the son
is arrayed against the father; brother against brother;
families against families; tribes against tribes. They
are divided into factions&mdash;religious, political and personal;
Christian and Pagan; American and British&mdash;the
followers of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> and <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, of Skonadoi
and Captain <span class="smcap">Peter</span>. The minister of destruction
is hovering over them; and before the passing away of
the present generation, not a single Iroquois will be seen
in this State."</p>

<p>This sad picture, although true to some extent, was
somewhat overdrawn in consequence of the agitation
and disputes which preceded the war with England in
1812; the Indian tribes being divided upon that question,
some of them taking up the hatchet for England, and
others, among whom were the Six Nations, for the United
States. But Gov. <span class="smcap">De Witt Clinton's</span> <i>prophecy</i> has utterly
failed. The influence and example of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
assisted by other good men, white as well as red,
leading their people to agriculture, and to habits of industry
and temperance, has saved from destruction a remnant
of the brave and once powerful nations, who lived
on these rivers and lakes, and possessed the land, both
far and near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> 30 </a></span></p>

<p>Here, at the grave of the venerated <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, we
can see the results of his principles, his measures and
example. Here he rests from his labors, but his works
do follow him. I see this in the evidences of civilization,
industry and competency around me. I see it in the
countenances of these intelligent and respectable people
of the Indian race, who are endeavoring to imitate his
example, and who come here this day to do honor to his
immortal memory.</p>

<p>The Indian name of the venerable Chief, to whose
memory this monument is erected, is written in different
manners, in publication documents and papers, which
have come under my notice. At the treaty of Fort Harmer,
his name was given thus: "Gy-ant-wa-chi-a;" and
this orthography I prefer. It means The Planter. But
it is, also, elsewhere written, "Gy-ant-wa-hia," and in this
form it appears on this monument; also "Ki-on-twog-ky,"
"Gy-ant-wa-ka," "Ki-end-twoh-ke," and "Cy-ent-wo-kee."
In Mr. <span class="smcap">Day's</span> historical collection of Pennsylvania,
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Stone's</span> Life of <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, and in some
other modern works, he is named, "Ga-nio-di-euh," or
"Handsome Lake;" but this is an error. That was the
name of a half-brother of our Chief, who was also designated
as the prophet, to whom I shall hereafter have occasion
to refer. Our Chief was frequently designated as
Captain <span class="smcap">O'Bail</span>, or <span class="smcap">ABeel</span>, (Captain being the highest
military distinction known to the Indians;) but he was
generally named and best known as <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> or
<span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>.</p>

<p>He was born at Ganowaugus, otherwise written Connewaugus,
an important town of the Seneca Indians, situated
on the Genessee river, and on the trail or main road
through the country of the Six Nations, to Niagara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> 31 </a></span></p>

<p>We have no precise knowledge of the date of his birth.
He has been heard to say, that he and General <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
were about the same age. This would place his
birth in the year 1732. In 1831, <span class="smcap">Thomas Struthers</span>,
Esq., of Warren, visited <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> at his house, in
this town, on which occasion the Chief, in answer to the
question, "How old are you?" replied, "One hundred
years." I saw him in the summer of 1834. At my interview
with him, Mr. <span class="smcap">George Powers</span>, of Franklin,
Venango county, acted as interpreter. On that occasion
he said he was more than one hundred years of age. A
learned writer,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> speaking of a younger brother of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
named "Ganeodiyo, or Handsome Lake," says
"he was born at the Indian village of Ga-no-wau-ges,
near Avon, about the year 1735." He was a half-brother
of our hero, having the same <i>mother</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Thatcher</span>,
in his Indian biography, and some other writers, have
fallen into the gross error of making their relationship
through a common <i>father</i>. I refer, in this connection, to
the statement of the time of the birth of "Handsome
Lake," in conjunction with the other facts mentioned, as
corroborative of the probability, that the subject of these
remarks was born about the year 1732.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Mr. Morgan.</span></p></div>

<p>At that period, the trade with the Six Nations was
chiefly in the hands of the English. One of their principal
traders was <span class="smcap">John ABeel</span>,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> generally named <span class="smcap">O'Bail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span></span>
or <span class="smcap">O'Beel</span>; his name is mentioned in the annals of that
period on several occasions. At one time it is stated, that
he made presents of considerable value to the Indians. It
was one of the hospitable customs of these people, to give
their friends a wife. <span class="smcap">John ABeel</span> had his Indian squaw,
and <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was the fruit of that temporary union.
Although we have no certain information on the subject,
I think it probable that the mother was the daughter of
an Indian Sachem. I infer this from the fact, that the
best and most respectable traders of that period, were
regarded with great favor by the Indians, and also from
the important circumstance, that three of her sons were
recognized as Chiefs of the Seneca tribe, namely: her
celebrated son, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and her younger sons,
Ga-ne-o-di-yo, or Handsome Lake, and Ta-wan-ne-ars,
or Blacksnake.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> I have recently been informed that <span class="smcap">John ABeel</span>, the father of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
was a Hollander or Dutchman. The inaccurate way of writing
the name <span class="smcap">O'Bail</span>, has given rise to the statement, generally believed, that
he was of a different nation. I learn that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> visited a nephew
of <span class="smcap">John ABeel</span>, who resided in the city of New York, and their relationship
was recognized. I have this information from a great-grandson
of the nephew referred to. The original manner of writing the name was
<span class="smcap">ABeel</span>. The family now write it <span class="smcap">Abeel</span>. I regret that the name is inaccurately
engraved on the monument erected at Jennesadaga.</p></div>

<p>We may also reasonably infer that she faithfully and
carefully discharged her duty to her offspring, in accordance
with the light and knowledge which she possessed.
It was the Indian woman who planted the fields of corn,
and kept the wigwam, when the hunter was in the forest,
or the warrior was upon the war path. Their attachment
to localities was greater than that of the Indian
men. It sometimes happened that Indian women interposed
to prevent grant of lands by the chiefs and warriors.
They desired to preserve their wigwams, their
fields and their orchards. The father of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
being absent, chiefly residing at Albany, or on the Mohawk
river, the mother's influence was uncontrolled. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> 33 </a></span>
think it highly probable that the remarkable attachment
to the <i>land</i>, exhibited by <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> on all occasions,
was the result, in some good degree, of the teachings of
his mother. When he speaks at the treaties, or sends a
"talk" or a message to the Chief of the thirteen tires,
or to "Corlaer," (New York,) or to "Onas," (Pennsylvania,)
he says: "We do not want money or goods; we
want homes; we want land; the trader's goods soon
wear out, the land lasts forever."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> refers to his birth and childhood in his
interesting address to the Governor of Pennsylvania, in
1822, when the question of taxing his property, hereinafter
mentioned, was raised.</p>

<p>"I feel it my duty to send a speech to the Governor
of Pennsylvania at this time, and inform him the place
where I was from; which was <i>Connewaugus</i>, on the Genessee river.</p>

<p>"When I was a child, I played with the butterfly, the
grasshopper and the frogs. As I grew up, I began to
pay some attention and play with the Indian boys in the
neighborhood, and they took notice of my skin being of
a different color from theirs, and spoke about it. I inquired
of my mother the cause, and she told me that my
father was a resident of Albany. I still ate my victuals
out of a bark dish&mdash;I grew up to be a young man, and
married me a wife&mdash;but I had no kettle or gun. I then
knew where my father lived and went to see him, and
found he was a white man and spoke the English language."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>The period when <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> and his family removed
from Connewaugus and the Genessee country is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34 </a></span>
unknown. Probably not until his native town was destroyed
by General <span class="smcap">Sullivan</span>, in his expedition against
the Six Nations, in 1779. Of that expedition, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
speaks in his address to General <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
in 1790. From the strong and eloquent language used
by him, and which I shall have occasion hereafter to cite,
it is probable he was an eye witness of the desolation produced
by <span class="smcap">Sullivan's</span> army.</p>

<p>Of the early career of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, we have but little
information. It is generally understood that his first
appearance as a warrior, was at the battle of the Monongahela,
in 1755, where <span class="smcap">Braddock</span> was defeated, and
that he fought on the side of the French in that bloody
field.</p>

<p>A word here explanatory of the position of the Senecas,
and their relations with the Indians of the League,
and other neighboring nations, may be useful. The
Seneca tribe was more exposed to the French and their
Indian allies on the lower Ohio and the lakes, than the
other members of the League. They had the important
and dangerous duties of keeping "the western door
of the long house," as they termed their possessions.
Their watch and ward extended from the Susquehanna
to the Ohio and great lakes. The duplicity, and in fact
treachery of the English crown, during the reign of the
<span class="smcap">Stuarts</span>, in not only abandoning the Six Nations in
their war with the French which they had undertaken
in the interest of the English, but when the League had
defeated the French and well-nigh conquered them, the
English government compelled them to make peace with
France, and submit to the terms which the French dictated.
These terms, however could not concede to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span>
French a region of country from which they had been
expelled, and which was in fact occupied by the Six Nations;
and thus the whole country, south of the chain of
the great lakes, was rescued from Canada. Referring to
this period, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bancroft</span> says: "In the course of events,
New York owes its present northern boundary to the
valor of the Five Nations. But for them, Canada would
have embraced the basin of the St. Lawrence."<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> Although
the Six Nations were afterwards informed that
the treachery and duplicity herein referred to, was not
approved by the successors of the <span class="smcap">Stuarts</span>, nor by the
English people, but was the result of the bad conduct
of English kings who were under French influence, yet
it left an impression on their minds which had an injurious
effect in after years.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> History United States, volume II, page 424.</p></div>

<p>By the regulations of the League, in cases where the
United Council did not act authoritatively for the whole
Confederacy, it appears that the separate tribes were not
precluded from engaging in war; nor individual warriors
prevented from taking up the hatchet, as inclination
might lead them. Acting under these principles, some
of the Six Nations fought on the side of the French,
during the war of 1755 and 1762, including that part of
the Senecas who had their seat north of the Ohio, and
below Fort Duquesne; and some on the upper Ohio,
now called Allegheny, united with them. From these
considerations it is not at all improbable that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
then a warrior of twenty-three years of age,
was on the war path at <span class="smcap">Braddock's</span> defeat. It was
probably his first battle, as it was also the first in which
our <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was engaged. The Indians of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span>
Ohio and the lakes were, at this period, more apprehensive
of the encroachments of the Virginians and the English
generally, than of the French. The former were
accompanied by the land surveyor and the woodman's
axe;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> the latter had in their train only the engineer to
build forts, and a commissariat which supplied the wants
of the Indians, as well as their own. Hence, a portion
of the Senecas, of the upper Ohio, were induced to take
the side of the French. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, with a portion
of his tribe, probably formed a part of that martial array
which we are told set forth from Fort Venango, at the
mouth of Venango river, now called French creek,
(Franklin, Pennsylvania,) for the forks of the Ohio, embarked
in three hundred canoes and batteaux, and having
eighteen pieces of cannon.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> a few years later than this period the Virginians made great encroachments
upon the boundary of the Indians. Lord <span class="smcap">Dunmore</span> and others,
claimed large bodies of land north of the Ohio. The Indians, for a long
period of time, claimed that the Ohio was the boundary between them and
the whites. In 1773 Lord <span class="smcap">Dunmore</span> caused surveys to be made at the Falls
of the Ohio; and lands in that region are now held under his warrants and
surveys.</p></div>

<p>The French war closed in the year 1763, by the treaty
of <span class="smcap">Utrecht</span>. The Indian tribes were at peace with each
other and with their white neighbors. It was about this
time that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> married a wife, an Indian
woman of his own tribe. When that important event
took place, he, himself, informs us, that he was not well
provided for housekeeping. He "had no gun, and his
wife no kettle." Under the impression that his father
would provide these useful articles for him, he made a
journey to Albany, to see him. But he was disappointed.
In <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> own account of the interview, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37 </a></span>
says: "When I started home my father gave me no provision
to eat on the way. He gave me neither kettle
nor gun. Neither did he tell me that the United States
were about to rebel against the government of England."
This conduct was alike unnatural and unjust. For, if
the result of the French war had impoverished the
Indian trader, of which we have no knowledge, he, at
least, might have given his son some information of the
dark clouds which were beginning to gather between
England and the colonies, and which soon afterwards
brought on the Revolutionary war. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, in
the address just referred to, intimates that it was a want
of knowledge of the questions in dispute, in conjunction
with other causes which he mentions in his address
to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, in 1790, led the Confederacy to take
part, in favor of the King of England, in the war which
ensued.</p>

<p>He says, in the address referred to, he was opposed
to joining in the conflict, inasmuch as the Indians had
nothing to do with the difficulties that existed between
the two parties. If he had more clearly understood the
points in dispute his opposition might have been more
effective. When <span class="smcap">Brant</span>, early in the year 1777, with
his Mohawks, had organized a hostile expedition, in connection
with some loyalists of that region, to attack
Unadilla, in New York, on the Upper Susquehanna, an
embassy of Sachems and war Chiefs of the Senecas and
Cayugas repaired to Oghwago, to which place <span class="smcap">Brant</span>
had advanced, to remonstrate with him against further
hostilities to the Americans. <span class="smcap">Brant</span> yielded to their
councils and protestations, and withdrew, with his Indians
and refugees, into the Cayuga country. <span class="smcap">Brant's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span></span>
exertions and interference had much to do in inducing
the Six Nations to take part against the united colonies.
Not long after the above occurrence, in an interview
with General <span class="smcap">Herkimer</span>, of the Revolutionary army, he
said: "The Indians were in concert with their King, as
their fathers had been. The King's belts, of Wampum,
are yet lodged with them, and they cannot violate their
pledges. General <span class="smcap">Herkimer</span> and his followers have
joined the Boston people against their sovereign. And,
although the Boston people were resolute, yet the King
would humble them. That General <span class="smcap">Schuyler</span> was very
smart on the Indians, at the treaty of German Flats,
but, at the same time, was not able to afford the smallest
article of clothing; and finally, that the Indians had
formerly made war on the white people, when they were
all united, and as they were now divided the Indians
were not frightened."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Stone's</span> life of <span class="smcap">Brant</span>, quoting from the <span class="smcap">Herkimer</span> papers and annals
of Tryon county.</p></div>

<p>But when the representative Chiefs of the Confederacy
at Oswego, at a general council held in the summer of
1777, decided to take up the hatchet for the King of
England, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> and his tribe considered themselves
bound by the decision. His nation was at war,
and he had to be at war. As the boys say at school,
"when you are in Rome, you must do as Rome does."
In his address to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, at Philadelphia, in 1790,
he justifies, or at least palliates the conduct of his nation
in taking the side of the King, in the following eloquent
and impressive words: "Father, when you kindled your
thirteen fires separately, the wise men assembled at them
told us you were all brothers&mdash;the children of one great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span>
Father, who regarded the red people as his children.
They called us brothers, and invited us to their protection.
They told us that he resided beyond the great
water, where the sun first rises, and that he was a King,
whose power no people could resist, and that his goodness
was as bright as the sun. What they said went to
our hearts. We accepted the invitation and promised
to obey him. What the Seneca nation promise, they
faithfully perform. When you refused obedience to that
King, he commanded us to assist his beloved men in
making you sober. In obeying him, we did no more than
yourselves had led us to promise. We were deceived;
but your people teaching us to confide in that King, had
helped to deceive us, and we now appeal to your heart.
Is all the blame ours?"</p>

<p>In addition to these considerations, thus cautiously
presented by <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, it is well known that the
hostilities commenced on the north-western frontier of
Virginia, by the cruel and unprovoked war waged against
the Indians by the land-jobbers, under the direction of
the notorious Captain <span class="smcap">Michael Cresap</span>, had a decided
effect upon the Six Nations, in determining on which
side they would take in the conflict which soon followed.
The atrocious murder of the family of <span class="smcap">Logan</span>, by <span class="smcap">Cresap</span>,
is well known, and need not be repeated on this occasion.
<span class="smcap">Logan</span> was the son of <span class="smcap">Shikellimus</span>, a distinguished
Cayuga Sachem. <span class="smcap">James Logan</span>, an eminent
member of the Colonial Council of Pennsylvania, was the
friend of <span class="smcap">Shikellimus</span>; the Sachem had named his son
for Mr. <span class="smcap">Logan</span>. <span class="smcap">Conrad Weiser</span>, the well known Indian
agent and interpreter, writing from Tulpehocken, in
Berks county, under date of July 6, 1747, to Secretary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> 40 </a></span>
<span class="smcap">Peters</span>, says: "<span class="smcap">Shikellimus</span> gives his respects to his;
old friend, Mr. <span class="smcap">Logan</span>. He intends to see him in Philadelphia
before next fall."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> <span class="smcap">Shikellimus</span> had been sent
by the Six Nations to preside over and govern the Delawares,
Shawanees, Conoys, Nantikokes, Monseys and
Mohicans. This interesting fact shows the superior power
and authority of the Six Nations, and that these tribes
were subordinate to them. <span class="smcap">Shikellimus</span> resided at Shamokin,
a large Indian village near the junction of the
North and West Branches of the Susquehanna river, the
site of the present borough of Sunbury, in Northumberland
county, Pennsylvania. This memorable Sachem,
governed these tribes with ability and integrity, for a
great many years.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> Colonial Records of Pennsylvania.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Logan</span> had a temporary residence on, Kishicokelas
creek, a beautiful limestone spring, a mile or two above
the wild gorge where the creek passes Jack's mountain,
(now in Mifflin county, Pennsylvania). Here he lived
several years. This was before the year 1768, when, by
the treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Indians relinquished to
the proprietary government all that region of country.
He then moved with his family to the country beyond
the Ohio, and fixed his cabin below Wheeling, where, a
few years later, his whole family were barbarously murdered.
On the Sciota, in 1774, he delivered his well
known speech to Lord <span class="smcap">Dunmore</span>, first published in Mr.
<span class="smcap">Jefferson's</span> notes on Virginia. A careful historian,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Day</span>, says: "That it is now well authenticated that
<span class="smcap">Logan</span>, himself, composed the speech, and that the common
supposition, that Mr. <span class="smcap">Jefferson</span> was the author of
it, is an error."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> 41 </a></span></p>

<p>It is well known that <span class="smcap">Logan</span>, born at Shamokin, where
the Moravians had a missionary station, received some
rudimental education from them, and was baptized; his
father, <span class="smcap">Shikellimus</span>, giving him the name <span class="smcap">Logan</span>, after
his friend <span class="smcap">James Logan</span>, the Secretary of the Province.
<span class="smcap">Logan's</span> speech, on the occasion referred to, though often
published, I insert here. It was as follows: "I appeal
to any white man to say, if ever he entered <span class="smcap">Logan's</span>
cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came
naked, and he clothed him not. During the course of
the last long and bloody war, <span class="smcap">Logan</span> remained idle in
his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for
the whites that my countrymen pointed, as they passed,
and said, '<span class="smcap">Logan</span> is the friend of white men.' I had
even thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries
of one man, Colonel <span class="smcap">Cresap</span>, the last spring in cold
blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of
<span class="smcap">Logan</span>, not even sparing my women and children. There
runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living
creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought
it. I have killed many. I have fully glutted my vengeance.
For my country I rejoice at the beams of peace.
But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear.
<span class="smcap">Logan</span> never felt fear. He will not turn his heel to save
his life. Who is there to mourn for <span class="smcap">Logan</span>? Not one."</p>

<p>The cruel murder of the family of <span class="smcap">Logan</span>, (himself a
distinguished Chief, and the friend of the whites and of
peace,) made a deep impression upon the Six Nations,
and was probably one of the causes which induced them
to take up the hatchet for the King of England. The
final decision, as already stated, was made at Oswego,
where the representative Chiefs and warriors were assembled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span>
being, drawn thither by the united exertions of
Sir <span class="smcap">John Johnston</span> and Colonel <span class="smcap">John Butler</span>, aided
by <span class="smcap">Brant</span>, the indefatigable and bitter enemy of the
united colonies. The British commissioners promised
the Indians an ample reward if they would assist the
English to subdue the rebel colonies. The Chiefs, in reply,
stated that they were bound, by the treaties at German
Flats and Albany, to be neutral to the war. Their
objections, however, were overcome, by the commissioners
telling them, "that the people of the colonies were
few in number, and would be easily subdued; and that,
on account of their disobedience to the King, they justly
merited all the punishment that it was possible for white
men and Indians to inflict upon them." "The King,"
they said, "was rich and powerful, both in money and
subjects. His rum was as plenty as the water in Lake
Ontario, and his men as numerous as the sands upon its
shore. And the Indians were assured that if they would
assist in the war, and persevere in their friendship for
the King, until its close, they should never want for
goods or money." Overcome by these importunities,
and by a recital of the injuries they had received from
some of the people of the colonies, aided by a display
of a large quantity of trinkets, blankets, clothes, guns,
and other articles and implements, the Indians concluded
a treaty of alliance with Great Britain, and took up the
hatchet against the united colonies. At the close of the
treaty, each Indian was presented with a suit of clothes,
a brass kettle, a gun, a tomahawk and scalping-knife, a
quantity of ammunition and a piece of gold. <span class="smcap">Mary
Jemison</span>, from whom we quote this statement, says, "as
late as 1823, the brass kettles received at Oswego, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"> 43 </a></span>
in use by the Senecas." Here <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, no doubt,
secured the "gun and kettle" which he had, in vain,
expected from his father. And the contrast between
these munificent gifts, and the fact stated by <span class="smcap">Brant</span>,
that General <span class="smcap">Schuyler</span>, at the treaty of German Flats,
was not able to afford to the Indians the smallest article
of clothing, no doubt assisted to turn the scale in
favor of the King.</p>

<p>During the military operations which followed this important
transaction, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> fought against the
United States. It is said that he was in the bloody battle
of Wyoming, which occurred on the 3d of July, 1778.
It is considered to be a doubtful point, whether the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Brant</span> was in that battle. There is high poetical
authority<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> in favor of it, and some corroborative
evidence of the fact. But there is no evidence that has
come under my notice, that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was present.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Campbell's</span> Gertrude of Wyoming.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was with his tribe, in endeavoring to
resist the advance of General <span class="smcap">Sullivan</span> into the country
of the Six Nations, in the year 1779. He was present
and took part in the battle of New Town, the present
site of Elmira, New York, where the Indians and
British troops, the latter under the command of Colonel
<span class="smcap">John Butler</span>, were signally defeated. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
and <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span> were with the Senecas. We do not
know which of these Chiefs had the immediate command
of the warriors of that tribe. It is known, however,
that <span class="smcap">Brant</span>, who had by general consent a superior authority,
charged <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span> with being the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"> 44 </a></span>
cause of the disaster of that day, and said that although
he was a great orator, he was no warrior; on the contrary,
he was a coward. In a council held some years
afterwards, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> made a similar charge against
<span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, to which the latter replied, "I am an orator&mdash;I
was born an orator."</p>

<p>This decisive action on the Chemung, was followed by
the devastation of the Indian towns and settlements
throughout the country of the Senecas and Cayugas.
They had several towns and many large villages laid
out with a considerable degree of regularity. They had
framed houses, some of them well finished, and painted
and having chimneys. They had broad and productive
fields, and in addition to abundance of apples, they had
orchards of peaches, pears and plums. But after the
battle of New Town, terror led the van of the invader,
whose approach was heralded by watchmen stationed
upon every height, and desolation followed weeping in
his train. The Indians every where fled, as <span class="smcap">Sullivan</span>
advanced, and the whole country was swept as with the
besom of destruction. Towns were burned, fields laid
waste, cattle destroyed and the orchards cut down.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was a sad witness to the destruction of
his own home and village, and that of his people. He
refers to these scenes most eloquently, in his address to
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, in 1792. "When your army entered the
country of the Six Nations, we called you the "town
destroyer;" and to this day, when that name is heard,
our women look behind them, and turn pale, and our children
cling close to the necks of their mothers. Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> 45 </a></span>
councillors and warriors are men, and cannot be afraid,
but their hearts are grieved with the fears of women and
children."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Stone</span> in his Life of <span class="smcap">Brant</span>.</p></div>

<p>This expedition of General <span class="smcap">Sullivan's</span>, was followed
by numerous retaliations by the Indians. The most
prominent of which was the invasion of Schoharie and
its destruction, together with the towns and settlements
in the valley of the Mohawk. Whilst Sir <span class="smcap">John Johnston</span>
and <span class="smcap">Brant</span> had the principal command, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
led his tribe in this invasion, and was in the
battle of Klock's Field, on the Mohawk river; the result
of which was a decided check upon the Indians and their
allies, and compelled them to fall back to Oswego.</p>

<p>The residence of <span class="smcap">John ABeel</span>, the father of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
was in the vicinity of the recent battle ground.
Before retiring with his warriors, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> made a
detour in the direction of his father's residence, and took
him prisoner. After taking him a few miles into the
forest, he made to him the following address: "My name
is <span class="smcap">John ABeel</span>, commonly called <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>. I am
your son. You are my father. You are my prisoner,
and subject to the customs of Indian warfare. But you
shall not be harmed. You need not fear. I am a warrior.
Many are the scalps I have taken. I am your son.
I was anxious to see you, and greet you in friendship. I
went to your cabin and took you by force; but your life
shall be spared. Indians love their friends and their
kindred, and treat them with kindness. If you choose
to follow the fortunes of your red son, and live with our
people, I will cherish your old age with plenty of venison,
and you shall live easy. But if it is your choice to
return to your friends, and live with your white children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> 46 </a></span>
I will send a party of my trusty young men to conduct
you back in safety. I respect you, my father. You have
been friendly to Indians. They are your friends." This
address shews the magnanimity of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and
that he could forget his father's neglect to supply him
with a "gun and kettle," on the occasion hereinbefore
mentioned. The elder <span class="smcap">ABeel</span> declined the offer. His
son fulfilled his word, and gave his father a suitable escort.
He returned to his dwelling in safety. The proud
Seneca and his warriors moved off to their own wilds.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>
These events transpired in 1780. Of the subsequent military
career of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, little is known. He probably
participated in the skirmishes and expeditions during
the subsequent years of the Revolutionary war and
until its close. He never spoke in after life of his career
as a Chief or warrior; and history gives us no details of
these expeditions and skirmishes, except as to the second
invasion of the Mohawk valley, and the battle of
Durlagh, in 1781, in which there is no mention of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
being present.</p>

"In every instance in which he has had an opportunity of testing by other

was an able man, distinguished in subsequent negotiations; he was an
eloquent orator and a great advocate for temperance."</p></div>

<p>The United States successfully maintained by the
sword the principles announced on the 4th of July, 1776,
at Philadelphia; and England, at the close of the war in
1783, acknowledged their independence. From that period
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> became the friend of the United
States, and the uniform and consistent advocate for peace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
He put forth, on all occasions, his best efforts to secure
the friendship of the United States, and to preserve his
nation from the destruction which seemed so eminently
impending. England, in her treaty of peace, made no
provision for her allies of the Six Nations. Many of the
Chiefs of the latter were disposed to make common
cause with the other Indians of the continent, and continue
the war. But the sagacious mind of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
led him to the just conclusion, that a continuance of the
war would be the destruction of his nation and tribe.
He was the chief instrument in effecting the treaty of
peace at Fort Stanwix, in 1784.</p>

<p>There had been a former treaty at Fort Stanwix,
namely: on the 5th of November, 1768, between the Proprietors
of Pennsylvania and the Chief of the Six Nations.
The territory granted to Pennsylvania, is particularly described
in the second volume of <span class="smcap">Smith's</span> Laws of Pennsylvania,
page 122-3. At the second treaty of Fort Stanwix,
held in October, 1784, the Pennsylvania commissioners
inquired what creek was meant by Tiadaghton,
also the Indian name of Burnett's hills, which was left
blank in the deed of 1768. The Indians then said that
Tiadaghton, is the same creek which the whites called
Pine creek, (now in Lycoming county). As to <span class="smcap">Burnett's</span>
hills, they called them the "Long mountains," and knew
them by no other name. The boundaries established by
the treaty of October 23, 1784, made the said Pine creek
the line, and down the same to its mouth, on the West
Branch of the Susquehanna; thence up the south side
thereof to the fork of the same river, which lies nearer to
a place on the Ohio river, (Allegheny,) called Kittanning,
and from the fork by a straight line to Kittanning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> 48 </a></span>
and thence down the said river Ohio, to where the western
bounds of Pennsylvania crosses the same river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> "very well knew," says Mr. <span class="smcap">Stone</span>, in
his life of <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, that by assenting to the large
cessions of territory exacted by the treaty, he was jeopardizing
his popularity with his people. But if others
had not, he had the sagacity to perceive, that although
he and his people had served the crown of Great Britain
with all fidelity, they had nevertheless been abandoned
to their fate by their more powerful ally, and the alternative
was presented to them of giving up as much of
their territory as the United States demanded, or of
yielding the whole of it. His course, and it was also the
course of wisdom, was prescribed by the necessity of the
case, and by the energy and ability with which he conducted
the negotiation, he yet retained for his people
an ample and beautiful territory. He was the most
prominent Indian Chief in the treaty of Fort Harmer,
in 1789.</p>

<p>By this treaty other grants of land were made. The
cession of the Presque Isle lands, is dated January 9,
1789, in which the signing Chiefs acknowledge the right
of soil and jurisdiction over that tract of country, ceded
by New York and Massachusetts, on the margin of Lake
Erie, including Presque Isle, and the bays and harbors
above the margin of Lake Erie. This territory was afterwards,
namely, on the 13th of April, 1791, purchased
from the United States, by the State of Pennsylvania,
for the consideration of $151,640 25, paid in Continental
certificates of various descriptions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was present as a prominent Chief, at
the treaty held with the Indians, in Marietta, Ohio, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"> 49 </a></span>
the year 1789. On this occasion, an elegant entertainment
was provided The utmost satisfaction appeared
to prevail among all the parties to the treaty. Good
wine was served after the dinner, and <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
being called on for a toast, took up a glass and said:
"I thank the Great Spirit for this opportunity of smoking
the pipe of friendship and love. May we plant our
own vines, be the fathers of our own children, and maintain
them."</p>

<p>The services of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> on this, and other occasions,
were highly appreciated by the Ohio Land Company.
This company was formed in 1786, by officers of
the army of the Revolution. At the close of the war of
1783, the officers and soldiers were paid in Loan Office
certificates, worth, in specie, about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the . On
the 16th June, 1783, a large number of them, with the
approval of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, memorialized Congress for
lands to settle on north-west of the Ohio river. The action
of the Government in this matter does not very
clearly appear, although it seems that the officers of their
Treasury recognized the validity of an arrangement to
receive loan certificates in payment for the land. In
1786, the Ohio company was organized, and by their
agents contracted with the Government for 1,500,000
acres of land, in the North-Western territory, for $1,000,000,
in Loan Office certificates, reduced to specie value.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the directors and agents of the company,
held at Campus Martius, (Marietta,) Ohio, February
9, 1789, the following proceedings were had:</p>

<p>"<i>Whereas</i>, <span class="smcap">Gyantwachia</span>, or <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>,
Chief of the Seneca nation, has since the treaty of peace,
made in the year 1784, between the United States and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span>
the Indian nations, in many instances, been of great service
to the United States; and the friendship he has
manifested to the proprietors of hind purchased by the
Ohio company, has been of particular service to them;
therefore,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That one mile square of the donation lands
be granted to <span class="smcap">Gyantwachia</span>, and his heirs forever,
in such place as the committee appointed to examine
proper places of settlement shall assign; and that the
duties, conditions and limitations required of other settlers
on such land, shall in this grant be dispensed with.
And the said committee of five are directed to give him
a deed accordingly."&mdash;[<i>Ohio Company Records, p, 54.</i>]</p>

<p>The above interesting transaction was communicated
to me by <span class="smcap">W. S. Ward</span>, Esq., of Marietta, Ohio. He
says, however, that there is no evidence, so far as he
can learn, that the committee or agents ever selected
this "mile square," donated to <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>; consequently
he received no deed for the land. Probably
there may be some documents on this subject among the
papers of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>. The Chief always carefully
preserved his important papers, and they are now in the
hands of his descendants at Jennesadaga.</p>

<p>The grants of lands made at these treaties, gave offence
to many of the Senecas and others of the Six Nations,
led on by the opposition of <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span> and
<span class="smcap">Brant</span>. He was not only vilified and misrepresented,
but his life was even threatened. He resolved to present
to <i>his</i> friend, and the friend of the human race,
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, the condition of his nation and his own
peril.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> came to Philadelphia, by the way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"> 51 </a></span>
Fort Franklin and Fort Pitt, traveling with his party
down the Allegheny river in canoes. At Fort Franklin,
ensign <span class="smcap">Jeffers</span>, of the 1st Pennsylvania regiment, was
in command. He furnished our Chief with a letter of
recommendation, in which he says: "The bearer hereof,
<span class="smcap">Cyentwokee</span>, the head Chief of the Seneca nation, is an
undoubted friend of the United States. When the Indians
have stolen horses and other things from our people,
I have known him, with the greatest dignity, to give
orders for them to be returned. I never knew his orders
to be disobeyed. When the people of Cussewago
(now Meadville) were about to fly on account of unfavorable
reports about some of the Southern (Western)
Indians, he sent a speech to me, in which he said, 'he
wished the people to keep their minds easy, and take
care of the corn fields, that the Six Nations were friends;
that should the Western Indians invade the settlements,
he would gather his warriors and help to drive them
to the setting of the sun.' In consequence of this, the
people rested easy. On his arrival here, he told me that
should I be invaded, so that I could not get provisions,
that he and his warriors would clear the way; he said that
at the Council at the Muskingum the great men asked
him which side he would die on? He told them on the
side of the Americans. He says he is of the same mind
yet. Sundry other things might be said, but as he is
now on his way to attend the Assembly at Philadelphia,
I will only recommend him to the particular attention
of the good people of Pennsylvania, between here and
that place. They may depend upon it, that they not
only entertain a friend, but a friend of great consequence,
for the Seneca nation is so much governed by him, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> 52 </a></span>
if he says <i>war</i>, it is <i>war</i>; and if he says <i>peace</i>, it is <i>peace</i>.
He is, therefore, a man worthy of the greatest attention.
The other Chiefs with him, second him in every thing,
and are men worthy of great attention."</p>

<p>This interesting letter was addressed "To the good
people between here (Fort Franklin) and Philadelphia."
It was of great service to <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> on his journey;
and when he arrived in Philadelphia, he placed it in the
hands of Governor <span class="smcap">Mifflin</span>. The paper is among the
archives of Pennsylvania, and is endorsed "1790, recommendary
letter from <span class="smcap">I. Jeffers</span>, ensign of the 1st Pennsylvania
regiment, commanding Fort Franklin, on French
creek, in favor of <span class="smcap">Cyentwokee</span>, or <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></p>

<p>It appears that from Pittsburg to Philadelphia, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
and his party were accompanied by Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph
Nicholson</span>, the interpreter. Dr. <span class="smcap">John Wilkins</span>,
Sr., writes from Shippensburg, to Gov. <span class="smcap">Mifflin</span>, under
date October 14, 1790, as follows: "I have just met at
this place, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and the other Indian Chiefs,
invited by Council. The reasons they assign for being
detained, are such as I hope will induce Council to exert
themselves in doing every thing in their power to give
them satisfaction. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> says when he was
preparing to come down, agreeably to the invitation
from Council, his nation was excited to great tumult, by
the killing the two Chiefs, on Pine creek, and he was
obliged to stay to pacify them. The Shawanese Indians,
who are the most troublesome, sent a message to the
Seneca nation, telling them, that unless they declared
war against the white people, they should be cut off.
This message had to be taken into consideration by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> 53 </a></span>
general Council of the Nation, and this required time.
The subject of this visit of the Chiefs of the Seneca nation
is of great consequence to the people of the western
country. The conductor and interpreter, Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph
Nicholson</span>, has brought them thus far at his own expense,
but his money being exhausted, I have advanced
him a sum sufficient to pay his expenses to the city. I
need not give you a character of the <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>; his
friendship for the people of Pennsylvania, his pacific
temper and integrity are sufficiently known."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>He traveled to Philadelphia, then the seat of government
of the United States, accompanied by his steadfast
friends and Chiefs of his nation, <span class="smcap">Half Town</span> and <span class="smcap">Big
Tree</span>. On the arrival of the Chiefs at Philadelphia, they
had an official audience with the President, on which
occasion <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> made an eloquent and dignified
address, and which called forth an appropriate reply
from <span class="smcap">Washington</span>. To <span class="smcap">Washington</span> he said, referring
to General <span class="smcap">Sullivan's</span> destruction of the Seneca towns:
"We called you the 'town destroyer,' but when you gave
us peace, we called you father, because you promised to
secure us in the possession of our lands. Do this, and
so long as the lands shall remain, that beloved name
shall live in the heart of every Seneca." He then gives
a terse and clear statement of the means taken to induce
the Six Nations to make such extensive grants of
their lands&mdash;grants, he adds, "made at a time when you
told us that we were in your hand, and that by closing
it, you could crush us to nothing; and you demanded
from us a great country as the price of that peace which
you had offered us; as if our want of strength had destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"> 54 </a></span>
our rights." Referring to his own conduct and
its effect upon his tribe, he uses the following eloquent
and patriotic words: "Father, we will not conceal from
you, that the Great God, and not man, has preserved
<span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span> from the hands of his nation. For
they continually ask, where is the land which our children,
and their children after them, are to lie down upon?
You told us, say they, that the line drawn from Pennsylvania
to Lake Ontario, would mark it forever on the
east, and the line running from Buffalo creek to Pennsylvania,
would mark it on the west, and we see that it
is not so. You, first one and then another, comes and
takes it away by order of that people, which you tell us
promised to secure it to us. He is silent&mdash;for he has
nothing to answer. When the sun goes down, he opens
his heart before God; and earlier than the sun appears
upon the hills, he gives thanks for his protection during
the night; for he feels, that among men become desperate
by their danger&mdash;it is God only that can preserve
him. He loves peace and all that he has had in store,
he has given to those who have been robbed by your
people, lest they should plunder the innocent to re-pay
themselves. The whole season which others have employed
in providing for their families, he has spent in his
endeavors to preserve peace. At this moment his wife
and children are lying upon the ground, and in want of
food. His heart is in pain for them, but he perceives
that the Great Spirit will try his firmness in doing what
is right."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span> made an appropriate reply to this address,
which he caused to be engrossed, and was signed by
himself and by Mr. <span class="smcap">Jefferson</span>, then Secretary of State,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"> 55 </a></span>
and presented to <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>. The Chief valued this
document among his highest treasures. A lithographic
copy of it has been prepared for this occasion, and I will
annex to this address, a copy of it and of the speeches of
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> made on that occasion. A single remark
made by <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, I here introduce. "The merits
of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and his friendship for the United
States, are well known to me, and shall not be forgotten."</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> arrived in Philadelphia, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
was absent at his seat in Virginia. In his absence,
the Chief was cordially received by the President
and members of the Executive Council of the State of
Pennsylvania. In the <i>Colonial Records</i> of Pennsylvania,
the following minutes appear:</p>

<p class="tdr">"<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, <i>Saturday, October 23, 1790</i>.</p>

<p>"Presents&mdash;His Excellency <span class="smcap">Thomas Mifflin</span>, Esq.,
President. <span class="smcap">Samuel Miles</span>, <span class="smcap">Richard Willing</span>, <span class="smcap">Zebulon
Potts</span>, <span class="smcap">Amos Gregg</span> and Lord <span class="smcap">Butler</span>, Esquires.
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> and five other Indian Chiefs were introduced
to Council. The President informed them, that
the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania was
happy to see them, and ready to hear what they had to
say. The Chief then made a short address, and asked
for further time to conclude what to say, which was
granted."</p>

<p>Subsequently the Chief made a more extended speech,
to which Governor <span class="smcap">Mifflin</span> made an appropriate reply.
Vol. XVI, p. 496.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span> continued to be the friend of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
to the end of his public career, and this confidence
and friendship afforded a source of consolation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"> 56 </a></span>
to the Chief, for the dissatisfaction of a portion of his
tribe, led on by the crafty <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, who opposed
some of the treaties, and favored a continuance of the
war, by the Indians, on their own account.</p>

<p>In these and subsequent transactions, which the limits
of this address prevent me from presenting in detail,
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> exerted his power and influence in favor
of peace. As early as 1791, he advocated the cultivation
of the soil, and the adoption of the arts of civilized
life, including the education of the Indian children. In
a letter of that year to Friends in Philadelphia, he says:
"Brothers, the Seneca nation see that the Great Spirit
intends they should not continue to live by hunting, and
they look around on every side and inquire, who it is that
shall teach them what is best for them to do? Your fathers
dealt honorably by our fathers, and they have engaged
us to remember it. We wish our children to be
taught the same principles by which your fathers were
guided. Brothers! We have too little wisdom among
us, and we cannot teach our children what we see their
situation requires them to know. We wish them to be
taught to read, and write, and such other things as you
teach your children, especially the love of peace." I
may here remark, that the Friends did respond to this
call, and through a long series of years, put forth the
most disinterested and philanthropic efforts in behalf of
the Seneca nation.</p>

<p>In 1791, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was employed by <span class="smcap">Washington</span>,
on behalf of the government of the United States,
to proceed into the country of the North-Western Indians,
then at war with the United States, on an embassy
of peace and reconciliation. This arrangement was made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> 57 </a></span>
during <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> visit to Philadelphia in that year.
Before proceeding on his mission, he returned to his
home on the Allegheny, and soon afterwards called a
Council of the Six Nations. The result of which was the
appointment of representative Chiefs of the Six Nations,
to attend a Council with the Western Indians. This
Council was held at Au Glaize, (Fort Defiance, Ohio,) in
October, 1792. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, accompanied by a large
number of the Chiefs of the League, was in attendance.
The hostile Indians were determined to insist upon the
river Ohio as their boundary; and besides the encroachments
of the whites upon their territory, they had other
grievances of which they complained. The Shawanese,
especially, were opposed to peace, except upon such
terms as they well knew would not be accepted by the
United States. Their principal orator said: "The President
well knows why the blood is so deep in our paths."
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> efforts to effect a reconciliation between
the Western tribes and the United States failed.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> Western Annals, p. 606.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, at this period, was perhaps the only
Chief of the Senecas and Six Nations, who remained
firm and unshaken in his friendship for the United States.
About this time the repulse of General <span class="smcap">Harmar</span>, by
the Western Indians, had greatly emboldened them, and
it was with great difficulty that the peaceful suggestions
of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> were acquiesced in by the Six Nations,
many of whom still desired to make common cause
with the Western tribes. In company with Colonel
<span class="smcap">Proctor</span>, of the United States army, he proceeded to
the country of the hostile Indians, and endeavored to reconcile
them to the United States. His mission failed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"> 58 </a></span>
chiefly through the evil influences of <span class="smcap">Brant</span> and <span class="smcap">Red
Jacket</span>, aided by the machinations of British officers.
At a subsequent period <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> renewed his efforts
for peace, and even called forth in favor of his
measures, the opinions of the Indian women, who, as is
natural to their sex, were the friends of peace. On this
occasion, <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, among other remarks, said to
the United States commissioners: "You know what
we have been doing so long, and what trouble we have
been at, and you know that it has been the request of
our head warrior, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, that we are left to answer
for our women, who are to conclude what ought to
be done." * * * *</p>

<p>"Colonel <span class="smcap">Butler</span>, of the British, told us he must take
our writings down to Colonel <span class="smcap">Gordon</span>,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> as he is a very
wise man, and perhaps he may have something to say
to us that may be for our good, and we want his assistance,
as he is the man that keeps all the vessels that are
on the Lake; therefore, my brother, make your mind
easy, for your request is granted. And when we hear
from our brothers, the British, then we shall know what
time to start. And you must not be uneasy, that our
brother, <span class="smcap">ABeel</span>, (<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,) can not go with you,
for he is very tired, (referring to his former journey,)
and must rest awhile, and take charge of our young warriors,
to keep them in peace while they are playing&mdash;for
fear of danger."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> The British commandant at Niagara.</p></div>

<p>The intrigue of <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, aided by the action of
the British officers, kept <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> from this mission.
There was, as suggested by a learned historian,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stone</span>, (in his life of <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>,) another reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> 59 </a></span>
lying still deeper in the minds of the Indian women, under
whose influence these proceeding's were had. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
was not only the principal war Chief of the
Senecas, but he was a man of great bravery and sagacity,
and withal a sincere friend of peace. The times
were critical, and the Indians at Buffalo creek, and the
adjacent country, were in frequent alarm. They wished
to retain <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, as he could best restrain the
warlike propensities of the young warriors, while they
could repose greater confidence, both in his bravery and
discretion, in the event of actual danger during the absence
of the messengers to the Western Indians, than in
any leader of their nation. This mission failed entirely.
"The man that kept the vessels on the Lake," refused
to recognize Colonel <span class="smcap">Proctor</span> in his official capacity,
and prohibited the passage of the Indian deputies to
Sandusky, on Lake Erie, their place of destination.</p>

<p>A treaty held at Painted Post, in June, 1792, between
Colonel <span class="smcap">Pickering</span> and the Six Nations, was productive
of peaceful and good results. It checked the disposition
of the young warriors to take part with the Western
Indians, and it led to another mission of peace, at
the head of which was the brave old Stockbridge Chief,
<span class="smcap">Henry Aupumut</span>. It was also at this treaty, that <span class="smcap">Washington</span>,
through his agent, Colonel <span class="smcap">Pickering</span>, made an
influential demonstration towards winning the attention
of the Chiefs to the policy of having permanent habitations,
where they could cultivate their lands, and commence
the work of civilization among their people.</p>

<p>After this period, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> made another, but
an unsuccessful embassy to the hostile Indians. His
efforts being unavailing, the war with the Western Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> 60 </a></span>
continued to rage until the year 1794, when, on
the 20th of August of that year, Gen. <span class="smcap">Wayne</span> achieved
his decisive victory over them at the battle of the Miami,
It was mainly due to <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> influence and exertions,
that the Six Nations were not involved in that
battle, and its fatal consequences to the hostile Indians
engaged in it.</p>

<p>Although the war with the Indians was terminated,
there were perplexing questions to settle between the
United States and the Six Nations, in which also, the
States of Pennsylvania and New York were concerned.
These were principally questions of boundaries, and also
in reference to the grant of Presque Isle and the adjacent
country. A Council was held at Buffalo creek, on the
18th of June, 1794, in reference to these difficulties. In
this Council, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> took a conspicuous part; his
speech on the occasion is fully reported in the proceedings.
I make room for a single observation&mdash;addressing
the commissioner as the representative of the President,
he said: "Brother! You know our demands; we
ask but for a small piece of land, and we trust, as you
are a great man, you can easily grant our request." It
is unnecessary, on this occasion, to give the details of
this Council, nor of the Great Council which was soon
after held at Canandaigua, namely, in October and November,
1794, at which <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, with other Chiefs,
represented the Six Nations. Colonel <span class="smcap">Pickering</span> was
again the commissioner on the part of the United States.
The Friends of Pennsylvania and New Jersey had also
agents present, and exerted a highly beneficial influence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stone</span>, to whose interesting work I am much indebted,
speaking of this treaty, says: "This was the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"> 61 </a></span>
general Council held by the United States with the Iroquois
Confederacy, and a vast amount of important business
was transacted thereat. Several perplexing questions
of contested boundaries were settled, and the relations
between the United States and the Confederacy
were adjusted upon a basis that has not been since disturbed."
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> arrived at this Council on the
second day after the day assigned for the meeting. He
came with four hundred of the Allegheny portion of the
Senecas. There were sixteen hundred Indians collected
on this interesting occasion. It appears that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
was subjected to some suspicions by his Indian associates,
because of his frequent interviews with Colonel
<span class="smcap">Pickering</span>. He was reminded by one of the Chiefs, that
he was but a <i>War Chief</i>, and was exceeding the bounds
of his proper department, by partaking too largely in the
conduct of civil affairs. Colonel <span class="smcap">Pickering</span> interposed,
and stated that the private interviews he had with <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
were at his special request. This explanation
was, for a time, satisfactory. Further evidences of the
distinction between the War Chiefs and Sachems were exhibited
on this occasion. <span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span> speaks of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
and Captain <span class="smcap">Brant</span>, (the latter was not present,)
as only War Chiefs, and the proceedings show that
which does not appear in other transactions, namely:
that there was a marked distinction between the <i>Chiefs</i>
and the <i>Sachems</i>, the former having the direction of
affairs belonging to war, and the latter having control of
the civil government, under certain restrictions dependent
upon popular opinion; and it appeared that they
regarded the military power as entirely subordinate to
the civil authorities. This single fact shows that the untutored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"> 62 </a></span>
Ho-de-no-sau-nee (United People,) had made no
inconsiderable advance in the science of free government.</p>

<p>Subsequent transactions between the whites and the
Indians, related to the sale of the lands of the latter.
Their power as a nation was gone. Henceforth, if they
were called together as a nation, or as separate tribes,
it was only through the agency of individuals or companies,
who desired to obtain grants of their lands. A
treaty of this character was held at Big Tree, in 1797,
(the site of the present town of Genessee New York,)
in reference to a claim of <span class="smcap">Robert Morris</span>, of Pennsylvania,
the assignee of the State of Massachusetts, of an
alleged pre-emption right to a portion of the territory
of the Seneca tribe.</p>

<p>Without entering into the details of this treaty, or
others of a similar character, I refer to it because it developed
one of the principles of government of the Confederacy,
heretofore but little known or noticed. An
appeal was taken by the women, from the opinion and
decision of the Sachems. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> being the principal
War Chief, presented the appeal, whereupon the
Council was re-opened, and the proceedings were recognized
by the Sachems, <span class="smcap">Farmer's Brother</span> being their
speaker, as being in accordance with their laws and customs.
The re-consideration resulted in a change in the
treaty beneficial to the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, at the head of his nation, as its principal
War Chief, had resisted the encroachment of the
whites to the extent of his abilities. But as we have
shown, when the fortune of war, under the superior power
of the Thirteen Fires, rendered further resistance impossible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"> 63 </a></span>
he had, as a wise statesman, made the best
terms of peace he could procure. After the Revolutionary
war, he desired to maintain friendly relations
with the United States; and to accomplish this object,
he was ready, when urgent necessity required it, to part
with considerable portions of the Indian territory. His
course of conduct, in these transactions, was severely
criticised by rival Chiefs, and under their influence, his
popularity, with the main portion of his tribe, and with
the other members of the Six Nations, was seriously reduced,
if not entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>It was during the period of his decline in power and
authority, that it is said he endeavored to regain his influence
by inducing his half-brother, Ga-ne-o-di-yo,
(otherwise called "Handsome Lake,") who was a Seneca
Sachem, to assume the character of a prophet. It
does not appear by any satisfactory evidence, that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
had any agency whatever in respect to the
alleged revelations made by his singular and talented
relative. In the account which Ga-ne-o-di-yo gives of
the trance which led to his revelations, after stating that
he had been ill for a long time, he says: "I resigned
myself to the will of the Great Spirit, and nightly returned
my thanks to Him, as my eyes were gladdened at
evening, by the sight of the stars of Heaven. I viewed
the ornamented Heavens at evening, through the opening
in the roof of my lodge, with grateful feelings to my
Creator. I had no assurance that the next evening I
could contemplate His works; for this reason my acknowledgments
to Him were more frequent and sincere.
When night was gone, and the sun again shed his light
upon the earth, I saw and acknowledged, in the return of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"> 64 </a></span>
day, His continued goodness to me and to all mankind.
At length I began to have an inward conviction, that my
end was near. I resolved once more to exchange friendly
words with my people, and I sent my daughter to summon
my brothers, Gy-ant-wa-chia, (<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,) and
Ta-wan-nears, (<span class="smcap">Black-snake</span>,) to come to my cabin."
The daughter hastened to deliver the message, but before
she returned with Ta-wan-nears, (<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was
not at hand,) the Sachem had fallen into a state of insensibility,
and lay for many hours in that condition;
after his recovery, he announced to his tribe what he regarded
as a revelation of the Great Spirit to the Indians,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

to Colonel <span class="smcap">Parker</span>, a Seneca Indian, now an officer of the United
States army, attached to the staff of General <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Chapter 3d of this
book is devoted to the pretended revelation of Ga-ne-o-di-yo, and the doctrines
of the religion he inculcated.</p></div>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was the half-brother of the prophet,
he was supposed to be in some way connected with these
revelations, more especially, as the prophet strongly inculcated
the principles of temperance, to which the
Chief had been, for many years, a devoted advocate.
<span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>, and others, used these transactions to the
disadvantage of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and from thenceforth
he ceased to take any part in the affairs of the Six Nations,
and but little in that of the Seneca tribe generally,
but devoted himself chiefly to his own clan of that
tribe. This clan, or part of his tribe, had for many
years been under his official and personal direction. Reference,
before this period, is often made to the <span class="smcap">ABeel</span>
Senecas, and in a map published in 1792, by <span class="smcap">Reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> 65 </a></span>

<p>In 1797, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> again visited Philadelphia,
the seat of government of the United States. His principal
object appears to have been to pay his respects to
President <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, and take an official leave of
him on his retirement from the public service. His address
to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, on this occasion, is marked with
his usual good sense and eloquence. This address was
fortunately preserved among the papers of <span class="smcap">Thomas
Morris</span>, son of <span class="smcap">Robert Morris</span>.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Washington's</span> answer was not preserved.
As he entertained the highest respect and esteem for
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, no doubt his words to the Chief were
expressive of his kind regards for his Indian friend, and
his best wishes for the happiness and prosperity of the
Seneca tribe.</p>

<p>From henceforth the career of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was unconnected
with the general history of his country. He
fixed his permanent residence upon the tract of land on
the Allegheny river, granted to him by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania. The grant from the Commonwealth
is dated March 16, 1796. In the patent the tract
is designated "Planter's Field," and his town is called
"Jennesadaga." It became his home in life, and is now
his resting place in death. Here he directed his efforts
to the civilization and moral improvement of his people,
and as an efficient means to produce the result inculcated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"> 66 </a></span>
the principles of temperance&mdash;to which he had himself
been long devoted.</p>

<p>In 1802 he visited President <span class="smcap">Jefferson</span>, at the city of
Washington, for counsel and encouragement. In Mr.
<span class="smcap">Jefferson's</span> excellent and characteristic letter to him, he
expresses his approbation of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> conduct,
and adds: "Go on then, brother, in the great reformation
you have undertaken. Persuade our Red Men to be
sober, and to cultivate their lands; and their women to
spin and weave for their families. * * * It will be a
great glory to you to have been the instrument of so
happy a change, and your children's children, from generation
to generation, will repeat your name with love
and gratitude forever. In all your enterprises for the
good of your people, you may count with confidence
on the aid and protection of the United States, and on
the sincerity and zeal with which I am animated in the
furthering of this humane work. You are our brethren
of the same land; we wish you prosperity, as brethren
should do." Thus encouraged, our Chief devoted his
time and energies to the best interests of his people, and
under his influence and example they made considerable
advances in civilization and moral improvement.</p>

<p>When the war of 1812, with England, broke forth,
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, although then far advanced in years, yet
he offered his services to the United States, to go on the
war path, and accompanied by two hundred warriors of his
nation, repaired to Franklin, Venango county, when he
learned that Colonel <span class="smcap">Samuel Dale</span> was about to march
from that place to the frontiers with the Venango regiment.
Arriving at Franklin, he called upon Colonel <span class="smcap">Dale</span>, and
desired a statement of the causes and objects of the war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> 67 </a></span>
which being satisfactorily explained to him, he made an
address, in which he said: "That many years ago a boy
came over the great waters and settled among his people
of the Six Nations; sometime thereafter the father
followed to keep him in subjection; the Indians helped
the father, but the boy was too much for both, and drove
the father home. And now, when the father had become
an old man, and the boy a strong man, and a good neighbor
to his nation, he wished to show his friendship for
the Thirteen Fires by taking his two hundred warriors to
assist to drive the old man across the great waters."&mdash;Colonel
<span class="smcap">Dale</span> was obliged to inform the Chief that he
had no authority to receive his warriors into his regiment,
or take them to the frontiers. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> insisted that
his warriors ought not to stay at home and live idly in
their wigwams whilst their white friends and brothers
were upon the war path. So persistent was he in sending
his warriors, that he could only be satisfied by the
promise of Colonel <span class="smcap">Dale</span> to send for them when their services
were required, and when he should receive authority
from the government to muster the Indians into the service
of the United States, and that in the mean time he
was to go home to his seat at Jennesadaga and have his
warriors ready to respond at a moment's call. They
were not called for by Colonel <span class="smcap">Dale</span>, but <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
sent a considerable number of his warriors to the American
army; they acted as scouts, and were highly serviceable
on the frontiers, and in the Niagara campaign.
His son, <span class="smcap">Henry ABeel</span>, led these warriors; he held the
the commission of major, and did good service to the
United States in that war.</p>

<p>The condition of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> town in 1816, is thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"> 68 </a></span>
described by Rev. <span class="smcap">Timothy Alden</span>, of Allegheny college,
Meadville, Pa., who visited it in that year: "Jennesadaga,
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> village, is on a handsome
piece of bottom land, and comprises about a dozen buildings.
It was grateful to notice the agricultural habits
of the place, and the numerous enclosures of buckwheat,
corn and oats. We also saw a number of oxen, cows
and horses, and many logs designed for the saw-mill
and the Pittsburg market. Last year, (1815,) the Western
Missionary society established a school in the village,
under Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Oldham</span>. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, as
soon as apprised of our arrival, came over to see us and
took charge of our horses. Though having many around
him to obey his commands, yet in the ancient patriarchal
style, he choose to serve us himself, and actually
went into the field, cut the oats and fed our beasts. He
appears to be about sixty-eight years of age,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> and five
feet ten inches in height. His countenance is strongly
marked with intelligence and reelection. Contrary to the
aboriginal custom, his chin is covered with a beard three
or four inches in length. His house is of princely dimensions
compared with most Indian huts, and has a
piazza in front. He is owner of thirteen hundred acres
of excellent land, six hundred of which encircle the
ground-plot of his little town. He receives an annual
stipend from the United States, of two hundred and fifty
dollars. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> brother, lately deceased, (called
the Prophet,) was known by the high-sounding name,
Goskukewanna Kannedia, or Large Beautiful Lake."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[X]</span></a> Mr. <span class="smcap">Alden</span> was deceived by appearances. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
time, about eighty-four years of age.</p></div>

<p>Thus, in the altitude and with the authority of an ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"> 69 </a></span>
patriarch, he continued to preside over his people,
and promote their prosperity and improvement, without
interruption or molestation, until the year 1822, when
the authorities of Warren county, within the bounds of
which he resided, attempted to levy taxes upon him and
his clan. The old Chief had never before been called
on for that purpose, and he objected to their payment.
An armed sheriff's <i>posse</i> was called out to enforce the
payment, but arriving near <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> town, it was
deemed prudent to send forward a few of their number
to confer with the Chief. When they came to his house,
they noticed a considerable number of Indians lounging
about, and some of them were partly concealed in
the bushes near by. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> received the committee
with great dignity. The interview took place
near his house, and around the sides of it were arranged
about one hundred rifles. When asked for the payment
of the taxes, the old warrior sternly refused, and pointing
to the guns, said, "an Indian for each rifle;" and in
response to his call, his clansmen sprang forward to the
house. Whereupon the sheriff and his men withdrew,
without enforcing the claim. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> afterwards,
for the sake of peace, went to Warren, and gave his note
for the amount of the taxes. This note was never collected.
The Legislature of Pennsylvania released the
taxes, and exonerated him and his heirs forever, from the
payment of taxes on the lands granted to him by the
Commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> The Governor sent commissioners to
explain the transaction. <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> met the commissioners
at the court house in Warren, when he made
a characteristic and appropriate address.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></p>

<p>This tax collector's raid would afford a fine subject
for a painter: the romantic scenery of the Allegheny
river, the old warrior's wigwam, the rifles arranged around
it, the Indians in the bush, the last war-whoop of the old
Chief as he called his men to the rescue&mdash;worthy of perpetuation
as the expiring flash of the warlike fire of the
last War Chief of his tribe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Struthers</span>, Esq., of Warren, was well acquainted
with <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>; at my request, he has furnished
the following statement of an interview he had
with the Chief in 1831: "In 1831, I accompanied some
gentlemen, residents of Pittsburg and Butler, who desired
to pay their respects to him. It was a pleasant
day in May, when we called on him. He talked no English.
I introduced the gentlemen through an interpreter,
whom I had engaged, and informed him that they had
called to pay their respects to him. He seemed much
pleased that his white friends were inclined to pay him
such attention. The introduction took place in front of
his log cabin, on the bank of the Allegheny river. He
gave orders to some young Indians, the import of which
we soon ascertained, by the fact that they immediately
collected some boards, and placed them for seats around
a log sled, in the form of a hollow square. This done, the
old Chief pointed out to each of the party his seat, and
all sat facing inward. He then took his seat in the centre,
and announced that he was prepared to hear any
communications we had to make. I told him we had
not come to buy lands or timber, nor to trade for furs
and skins, but had called on him in the spirit of friendship,
to pay our respects to the great Indian Chief, whom
we had learned to admire as a warrior, and especially as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"> 71 </a></span>
the friend of the United States, who had inculcated the
principles of peace and Christianity among his people.
I referred briefly to the schools established among his
people by the Friends of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"The old Chief replied in a speech, which would compare
well with many of our best State papers. His manner
was dignified and eloquent, and his eye lit up, as if
by inspiration; so that it was very interesting to listen
to what he said, although we could not understand it,
until the interpreter rendered it to us. He spoke of the
relations between the white men and the red men&mdash;the
war and bloodshed caused by the former, to displace the
latter from their hunting grounds&mdash;the peace effected
with the Six Nations&mdash;dwelt particularly on the virtues
of General <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, the great and good White
Father. He brought forth from a well covered valise,
in which they were carefully wrapped in linen cloth, two
or three "talks," as he termed them, on parchment, to
which was appended the autograph of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>. He
said he had met <span class="smcap">Washington</span> a number of times, and
treated with him. His <i>single eye</i> sparkled with animation,
when his name was mentioned. And in conclusion,
he thanked the Great Spirit that there were now no wars
or blood-shedding going on, but that peace and good
will existed amongst all men and all nations, so far as he
could hear. He spoke as a statesman and philanthropist,
whose mind was occupied with the weighty interests
of mankind, rather than with merely the affairs and
concerns of a family or tribe. He thanked us for our
call upon him, and invited us to dine with him, which
we accepted. The bill of fare was jerked venison and
corn mush; the latter was prepared in the Indian manner;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"> 72 </a></span>
each guest having a tin pan about half-full of hot
water, in which the Indian meal was mixed at the pleasure
of the guest."</p>

<p>The personal appearance of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, towards
the close of his long and eventful life, is well described
by Judge <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>, now of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
in an article written in 1836, and re-produced
in <span class="smcap">Day's</span> Historical Collections of Pennsylvania, p. 657.
I had a professional interview with the aged Chief, in
the summer of 1835, to which I have already briefly referred.
His personal appearance was therefore known
to me. I agree with Judge <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>, in his description
of him, and as the article contains other interesting
remarks, I insert it here, as follows:</p>

<p>"I once saw the aged and venerable Chief, and had
an interesting interview with him about a year and a
half before his death. I thought of many things, when
seated near him beneath the wide spreading shade of an
old sycamore, on the banks of the Allegheny; many
things to ask him; the scenes of the revolution; the
generals that fought its battles and conquered the Indians;
his tribe; the Six Nations, and himself. He was
constitutionally sedate; was never observed to smile,
much less to indulge in the luxury of a laugh. When
I saw him he estimated his age to be over one hundred
years. I think one hundred and three was about his
reckoning of it. This would make him near one hundred
and five years old at the time of his decease. His person
was much stooped, and his stature was far short of what
it once had been&mdash;not being over five feet six inches at
the time I speak of Mr. <span class="smcap">John Struthers</span>, of Ohio,
told me, some years since, that he had seen him near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"> 73 </a></span>
fifty years ago, and at that period he was about his
height, viz: six feet, one inch. Time and hardship had
made dreadful impressions upon that ancient form. The
chest was sunken and his shoulders were drawn forward,
making the upper part of his body resemble a trough.
His limbs had lost their symmetry, and become crooked.
His feet, too, (for he had taken off his moccasins,) were
deformed and haggard by injury. I would say that most
of his fingers on one hand were useless; the sinews had
been severed by a blow of the tomahawk or scalping-knife.
How I longed to ask him what scene of blood
and strife had thus stamped the enduring evidence of
its existence upon his person. But to have done so,
would, in all probability, have put an end to all further
conversation on any subject. The information desired,
would certainly not have been received, and I had to
forego my curiosity. He had but one eye, and even the
socket of the lost organ was hid by the overhanging
brow resting upon the high cheek bone. His remaining
eye was of the brightest and blackest hue. Never have
I seen one, in young or old, that equalled it in brilliancy.
Perhaps it had borrowed lustre from the eternal darkness
that rested on its neighboring orbit. His ears had
been dressed in the Indian mode, all but the outside had
been cut away; on the one ear the ring had been torn
asunder near the top, and hung down his neck like a
useless rag. He had a full head of hair, white as the
driven snow, which covered a head of ample dimensions
and admirable shape. His face was not swarthy, but
this may be accounted for from the fact, that he was but
half Indian. He told me that he had been at Franklin,
more than eighty years before the period of our conversation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"> 74 </a></span>
on his passage down the Ohio and Mississippi,
with the warriors of his tribe, on some expedition against
the Creeks or Osages. He had long been a man of peace,
and I believe his great characteristics were humanity
and truth.</p>

<p>"It is said that <span class="smcap">Brant</span> and <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span> were
never friends after the massacre of Cherry valley. Some
have alleged, because the Wyoming massacre was, in
part, perpetrated by the Senecas, that <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>,
was there. Of the justice of this suspicion, there are
many reasons for doubt. It is certain that he was not
the Chief of the Senecas at that time.</p>

<p>"As he stood before me&mdash;the ancient Chief in ruins&mdash;how
forcibly was I struck with the truth of the beautiful
figure of the old aboriginal Chieftain, who, in describing
himself, said 'he was like an aged hemlock, dead at
the top, and whose branches alone were green.' After
more than one hundred years of most varied life&mdash;of
strife&mdash;of danger&mdash;of peace&mdash;he at last slumbers in deep
repose on the banks of his own beloved Allegheny."</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has acted with liberality and kindness
to this venerated Chief. She granted to him three valuable
tracts of land; on one of which he had fixed his residence.
It is the place where he now rests in the quietude
of the grave.</p>

<p>The first report on the subject of these grants to <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
is dated March 24, 1789. It is contained in a
communication from General <span class="smcap">Mifflin</span>, then President
of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, to
<span class="smcap">Richard Peters</span>, Speaker of the General Assembly, in
which he encloses General <span class="smcap">Richard Butler's</span> letter,
recommending the grant of fifteen hundred acres of land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"> 75 </a></span>
to <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>, a Seneca Chief.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> General <span class="smcap">Butler's</span>
letter is dated March 23, 1789. In it he says: "I
beg leave to mention, that Captain <span class="smcap">ABeel</span>, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">The
Cornplanter</span>, one of the principal Chiefs of the Seneca
tribe of the Six Nations, has been very useful in all the
treaties since 1784, inclusive, and particularly to the
State of Pennsylvania; this he has demonstrated very
fully, and his attachment, at present, to the State, appears
very great. This has induced me to suggest to
your Excellency and Council, whether it may not be
good policy to fix this attachment by making it his interest
to continue it. This, from the ideas he possesses
of civilization, induces me to think if the State would be
pleased to grant him a small tract of land within the late
purchase, it would be very grateful to him, and have that
effect. This may be done in a manner that would render
him service without lessening his influence with his
own people. The quantity need not be large; perhaps
one thousand or fifteen hundred acres. My wishes for
the quiet and interest of the State, as well as the merits
of the man, induced me to mention this matter."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a></p>

<p>The Great Founder of Pennsylvania established his
government on "deeds of peace." He has the unquestioned
pre-eminence of having treated the aboriginal inhabitants
with greater justice and rectitude than any
other Proprietor or Founder of an American State.&mdash;"The
settlement of this Province (Pennsylvania) was
founded on the principles of truth, equity and mercy,
and the blessings of divine Providence attended the early
care of the first founders to impress these principles on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"> 76 </a></span>
the minds of the native inhabitants; so that when their
numbers were great, and their strength vastly superior,
they received our ancestors with gladness, relieved their
wants with open hearts, granted them peaceable possession
of the land, and for a long course of time gave constant
and frequent proofs of a cordial friendship."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> It
is, therefore, an appropriate testimonial to the character
of <span class="smcap">Penn</span>, as well as to that of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, that the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania should, by her constituted
authorities, cause the erection of this monument to
the memory of this worthy and distinguished Indian
Chief. And it is the only monument, so far as my knowledge
extends, erected by public authority in the United
States, either national, or sub-national, to the memory of
an Indian Chief.</p>

<p>The character of the venerable <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> has been
exhibited, though I fear imperfectly, in this sketch of his
life and services. We have seen that he was a brave
warrior and chieftain, an able statesman and an eloquent
orator. In the latter part of his life, especially, his prominent
characteristics were a love of peace and temperance.
And it is believed by those who knew him best, that the
Truths of Christianity had made a deep impression on his
mind. A circumstance which occurred about the year
1822, has been cited by several writers as an evidence of
his return to the superstitions of his race. I refer to his
destroying a sword and pistols, and some other military
accoutrements which had been presented to him by
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, and a gold laced hat which was given him
by Governor <span class="smcap">Mifflin</span>; also a French flag and superb belt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"> 77 </a></span>
of wampum, trophies of valor, which had been for several
generations in his family, in honor of some of his mother's
ancestors, who won them in battle from the French.
It is alleged that he did this act in a moment of alarm,
as if the Great Spirit had moved him to destroy the
memorials of his friendly relations with the whites.
On the contrary, it clearly appears that under the influence
of Christianity, particularly as evinced in the
teachings of the Society of Friends, who had established
schools in his nation, he became so firm an advocate of
peace, that he wished to remove from him all the memorials
that re-called to his recollection the scenes of
war and blood through which he had passed. He carefully
preserved the memorials of peace of which he was
in possession. I myself noticed, for he exhibited them
to me, how great a regard he had for the parchment
documents which he possessed, that were subscribed by
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>; and with what scrupulous care and painstaking
he had preserved them. These papers, and others
of a like character, are now in the possession of the family
of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, and are most interesting historical
memorials. Their preservation, in such manner as may
be agreeable to the descendants of the Chief, is a matter
of interest and solicitude to all persons who properly appreciate
such materials of history.</p>

<p>Those who knew <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> personally, had the
greatest respect for him. Dr. <span class="smcap">Irvine</span>, of Brokenstraw,
a son of General <span class="smcap">C. Irvine</span>, an intimate friend of the
Chief, in a letter to me, says: "I frequently heard my
father say, that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was one of the most
honest and truthful men he ever knew, whether white
or red." Judge <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, of Warren, under whose direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"> 78 </a></span>
this (<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>) monument is erected, states
to me, "so far as he was personally known to residents
in this section of country, he was regarded as a living
example of integrity, truthfulness, purity, temperance,
fatherly affection for his tribe and race, and a generous
Indian hospitality to all. He possessed the universal
affection and veneration of his tribe and of all men who
knew him."</p>

<p>Such was the life and career of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>; and
such his character as shown from history, from the testimony
of contemporaries, and of living witnesses. He
died in this Indian village, (Jennesadaga,) on the 18th
of February, 1836, aged about one hundred and five
years.</p>

<p>This is no ordinary occasion. A great Commonwealth,
by a solemn act of legislation, and by her agents here
this day, honors the memory of the distinguished Indian
Chief, whose mortal remains lie mouldering in this
grave. We this day dedicate this monument to the
memory of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, an Indian Chief of the Seneca
tribe and of the Six Nations&mdash;and may we, both white
men and red men, and our children's children, as long
as this beautiful river bears its waters to the ocean, venerate
his memory and emulate his virtues.</p>

<h2><a name="ADDENDUM" id="ADDENDUM">ADDENDUM.</a></h2>


<p>I have recently examined Mr. <span class="smcap">Ketchum's</span> history of
Buffalo and the Senecas. The <i>facts</i> he presents corroborate
the views I have presented of the character and
services of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>. I am surprised, however, to
notice that he expresses an <i>opinion</i> adverse to our Chief.
He does him great injustice when he says; "There is
no doubt that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was at heart in the British
interest, up to the period of <span class="smcap">Wayne's</span> victory in 1794."
He also makes the extraordinary assertion, that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>
acted in concert with <span class="smcap">Brant</span>, during the period
of the Indian troubles in Ohio, after the Revolutionary
war!</p>

<p>The contrary most clearly appears by the whole course
of conduct of our Chief; as well as by his speeches, his
letters and his participation in treaties. With <span class="smcap">Brant</span>,
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> never was on friendly terms, and after
the war of the Revolution, their policy, and even personal
relations, were adverse and hostile. Mr. <span class="smcap">Ketchum</span>,
himself, shows that there existed between these Chiefs
"a personal dislike."</p>

<p>While <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was aiding <span class="smcap">Washington</span> and his
agents, Colonels <span class="smcap">Proctor</span> and <span class="smcap">Pickering</span>, and others, to
preserve peace with the hostile Indians of the west, and
conciliate the Six Nations, <span class="smcap">Brant</span> was the agent of the
British to keep up the war, and he even sent some of his
warriors to join the enemy, when they took up the
hatchet; he made his home with the British, and was in
constant communication with Colonels <span class="smcap">Gordon</span> and
<span class="smcap">M'Kee</span>, the commanders at Niagara and Detroit, and
with other British officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"> 80 </a></span></p>

<p>The writer referred to adds the following: "As a warrior,
whatever may be thought or said by whites, <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
in the estimation of the Indians who were their
contemporaries, was the superior of <span class="smcap">Brant</span>. The Senecas
were a nation of warriors; and it will be admitted that
they did the most of the fighting for the Six Nations,
during nearly two centuries of their history, with which
we are conversant. From the time <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> came
on the stage, (and he entered upon the war path early,)
down to the close of the Revolutionary war, he had no
superior, and few equals as a warrior. His other qualifications
will be judged by the record he has left in his
speeches and letters, and in the archives of our State and
National Government."&mdash;Vol. 1, p. 411.</p>

<p>I am content to let the personal and political character
of our Chief be judged by the records thus referred
to. And I think I have shown in this <span class="smcap">Memorial</span>, <i>from
these records</i>, that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> was not only a distinguished
warrior, statesman and orator, but that he was,
after the close of the Revolutionary war, the active,
faithful and devoted friend of the government and people
of the United States. And that he also well deserves
the inscription on the monument erected by Pennsylvania
to his memory, "Distinguished for talent, courage, eloquence,
sobriety and love for his tribe and race, to whose
welfare he devoted his time, his energies and his means,
during a long and eventful life."</p>

<p>There is one trait in the character of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
not heretofore noticed, which is referred to by Colonel
<span class="smcap">Proctor</span> in his narrative, and which I think ought to be
presented here. Colonel <span class="smcap">Proctor</span> was sent by <span class="smcap">Washington</span>,
to visit <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, to engage him and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"> 81 </a></span>
Chiefs, to go on an embassy of peace to the Western Indians.
He traveled by way of Wyoming and the Susquehanna.
I quote from his narrative, under the date of
March 20, 1791.</p>

<p>"This day we set forward for Captain Waterman
Baldwin's, above Wilkesbarre; arrived there in the evening,
halted for him part of two days, as I had orders to
take him with me to the residence of <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>,
at which place he was intended to act as instructor to
the Indian youth, as also a director in the mode and
management of agriculture, for the use and benefit of
the Indians. This gentleman was made prisoner by
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> during the late war, (Revolution,) <i>and
was treated by him with remarkable tenderness, until legally
exchanged</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="ADDRESSES" id="ADDRESSES">ADDRESSES</a><br />

OF<br />

JOHN LUKE AND STEPHEN S. SMITH.</h2>

<p>The following addresses were then made by the Indians
herein mentioned; they were translated by <span class="smcap">Harrison
Halftown</span> and <span class="smcap">Benjamin Williams</span>, both Senecas.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Snowden</span> took notes of these addresses, and
has written them out as follows:</p>

<p><a name="ADDRESS1" id="ADDRESS1"></a><span class="smcap">John Luke</span>, a councillor of the Seneca nation, said:
Brothers! White men and Indians:&mdash;It has been laid
upon me to say a few words. We were well pleased
when we heard that the State of Pennsylvania had directed
that a monument should be put up to the memory
of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>, at his grave. And we were pleased
when word came to us that the white people and Indians
should be here to-day to see the monument set in its
proper place, and to hear what our white brothers should
say on the occasion. We are thankful for what has been
done by Pennsylvania, and for the good words we have
heard this beautiful day. The occasion will long be remembered
by us. This monument, more enduring than
the wampum which our forefathers used to record events
and keep them in remembrance, will remind us of the
kindness of Pennsylvania to our great and good Chief,
and keep bright the chain whose links have united us to
the Quaker State even from the time of <span class="smcap">Onas</span> (<span class="smcap">William
Penn</span>) to the present day. Brothers! <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>
was known to us to be an honest man, and without
deceit, and we are glad to hear, by the words spoken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"> 83 </a></span>
this day, that our white brethren so regard him, and respect
his memory. He made the treaties and speeches
referred to this day, and I now say that it is proper that
all the people should remember that every word that has
been said, so far as I understand them, are words of truth.
We always understood that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> desired his
children, and his nation, to follow the example of the
white people in cultivating the land. It lies upon our
hearts that we should remember the words of <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>.</p>

<p>Friendship was established between the red men and
the white men by treaties, and we wish them to stand
permanent. This is all I have to say in behalf of my people.
Farewell!</p>

<p><a name="ADDRESS2" id="ADDRESS2"></a><span class="smcap">Stephen S. Smith</span>, a Seneca Indian, and a Chief of
the Six Nations, then rose and said: Friends and Brothers!
We are grateful for what is done and said here this
beautiful day. The sun shines upon us, and we are here
as brothers to do honor to the memory of old <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>.
It is in accordance with the laws and customs
of the Six Nations that the people should meet to
commemorate the memory of the dead.</p>

<p>Brothers! We are now a feeble people in numbers and
in power; our forefathers were strong and powerful.
This is known to us, and it is grateful to our hearts to
hear the history of the Six Nations described to us to-day.
It is gratifying to us to hear the words we have
heard this day, so true and plain, delivered by our brother,
from Philadelphia, who so well depicted the life and
character of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>. And here at his grave, where
his bones are buried, it is our duty to remember his instructions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"> 84 </a></span>
to his people, to work, and also, to plant our
land; and now it is our duty to prosecute that work as
his children. Brothers! We have been told that the Indians
are like the leaves which fall at this season of the
year. The leaves do fall, but we live in hope that the
next summer will bring them forth again. My wish is,
that what remains of the Six Nations, and their children's
children, should continue to live on the lands which they
now own by means of reservations secured to them by
the States of New York and Pennsylvania. I am not
willing to see the day when these hills will no longer look
down upon the cabins of our people. I hope they will
live here, and on the New York reservations, neighbors
of our friends, the white people, until we and they are
called away unto the place of everlasting rest; where
there is but one people, one mind and one tongue. I
hope our children, to the remotest generations, will come
here and look at this monument to old <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span>,
and read what is inscribed upon it; and my desire is that
the Indians of the Seneca nation should continue to live
here, not only as long as this handsome monument stands,
but as long as these hills and valleys remain, and the
waters of the Allegheny mingle with the Ohio and Mississippi.
And now, on behalf of my nation, I return
thanks to the State of Pennsylvania, and to our white
brethren present, for what has been so well done this
day; and say to all farewell.</p>

<p>The present condition of these remnants of the Six
Nations is quite respectable. In most of the reservations
they have schools and places of public worship.
Many of them belong to the Methodist and Baptist
churches. The Chief of the Six Nations, <span class="smcap">Stephen S.
Smith</span>, who made a speech at the inauguration of the
<span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> monument, is a minister in the Baptist

which will doubtless be interesting to our readers.</p>

October, and will send it to me for the use and benefit

our honored brother, <span class="smcap">John Luke</span>, who was with us at
the monument meeting last October, that he will be with
us no more at our meetings this side of the setting sun.
He took his departure for the great spiritual hunting
ground last April.</p>

<p class="tdr">"Yours truly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p>An appropriation having been made for that object,
by the Legislature at its last session, a substantial and
appropriate fence was placed around the grave and monument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"> 88 </a></span>
of <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> on the 20th of September, 1867.
It consists of marble posts with carved caps; iron rails
with chains and tassels, and presents a very handsome
appearance.</p>

<p>In honor of the completion of the monument, and to
express their thanks to the Great Spirit, and their gratitude
to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and her
agents, the Senecas had a "green corn feast," on the
23d, 24th and 25th of September. It was a great occasion,
and was largely attended. Their ceremonies had
relation not only to the completion of the monument,
but to express their thanks to the Great Spirit for the
abundant crops which have this year rewarded their agricultural
labors. The erection of the <span class="smcap">Cornplanter</span> monument,
and the proceedings relating to it, have had an
excellent and benign influence upon these Indians. A
friend writes to me: "The natives are greatly pleased
with all that has been done; they have better crops than
usual, and act more civilized. These proceedings have
increased their self-respect, and made an enduring mark
upon their grateful hearts."</p>

<h2>SPEECH OF CORNPLANTER,</h2>

<p class="center pmb2">TO PRESIDENT WASHINGTON, AT PHILADELPHIA, IN THE YEAR 1790.</p>


<p>Father! The voice of the Seneca nation speaks to you, the
great councillor, in whose heart the wise men of all the Thirteen
Fires have placed their wisdom. It may be very small in
your ears, and we therefore entreat you to hearken with attention,
for we are about to speak of things which are to us very
great. When your army entered the country of the Six Nations,
we called you the Town Destroyer; and to this day, when
that name is heard, our women look behind them and turn pale,
and our children cling to the necks of their mothers. Our councillors
and warriors are men, and cannot be afraid; but their
hearts are grieved with the fears of our women and children,
and desire it may be buried so deep as to be heard no more.
When you gave us peace, we called you father, because you
promised to secure us in the possession of our lands. Do this,
and so long as the lands shall remain, that beloved name shall
live in the heart of every Seneca.</p>

<p>Father! We mean to open our hearts before you, and we
earnestly desire that you will let us clearly understand what
you resolve to do. When our Chiefs returned from the treaty
at Fort Stanwix, and laid before our council what had been
done there, our nation was surprised to hear how great a country
you had compelled them to give up to you without your
paying, to us, anything for it. Every one said that your hearts
were yet swelled with resentment against us for what had happened
during the war, but that one day you would re-consider
it with more kindness. We asked each other, "What have we
done to deserve such severe chastisement?"</p>

<p>Father! When you kindled your Thirteen Fires separately,
the wise men assembled at them told us that you were all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"> 91 </a></span>
brothers, the children of one great father, who regarded, also,
the red people as his children. They called us brothers, and
invited us to his protection; they told us that he resided beyond
the great water where the sun first rises; that he was a
King, whose power no people could resist, and that his goodness
was as bright as that sun. What they said went to our
hearts, we accepted the invitation, and promised to obey him.
What the Seneca nation promise they faithfully perform, and
when you refused obedience to that King, he commanded us
to assist his beloved men in making you sober. In obeying
him, we did no more than yourselves had led us to promise.
The men that claimed this promise told us you were children
and had no guns; that when they had shaken you, you would
submit. We hearkened to them, and were deceived, until your
army approached our towns. We were deceived; but your
people, in teaching us to confide in that King, helped to deceive
us, and we now appeal to your heart&mdash;is the blame all
ours?</p>

<p>Father! When we saw that we were deceived, and heard the
invitation which you gave us to draw near to the fire which
you had kindled, and talk with you concerning peace, we made
haste towards it. You then told us that we were in your hand,
and that by closing it you could crush us to nothing, and you
demanded from us a great country as the price of that peace
which you had offered us&mdash;as if our want of strength had destroyed
our rights. Our Chiefs had felt your power, and were
unable to contend against you, and they, therefore, gave up
that country. What they agreed to has bound our nation, but
your anger against us must by this time be cooled, and although
our strength has not increased, nor your power become less,
we ask you to consider calmly, were the terms dictated to us
by your commissioners reasonable and just?</p>

<p>Father! Your commissioners, when they drew the line which
separated the land then given up to you, from that which you
agreed should remain to be ours, did most solemnly promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"> 92 </a></span>
that we should be secured in the peaceable possession of the
lands which we inhabited east and north of that line. Does
this promise bind you?</p>

<p>Hear now, we beseech you, what has happened concerning
that land. On the day in which we finished the treaty at Fort
Stanwix, commissioners from Pennsylvania told our Chiefs
that they had come there to purchase all the lands belonging
to us within the lines of their State, and they told us that their
line would strike the river Susquehanna, below Tioga Branch.
They then left us to consider of the bargain till next day. On
the next day, we let them know that we were unwilling to sell
all the lands within their State, and proposed to let them have
part of it, which we pointed out to them in their map. They
told us that they must have the whole; that it was already
ceded to them by the great King, at the time of making peace
with you, and was <i>their own</i>; but they said that they would
not take advantage of that, and were willing to pay us for it&mdash;after
the manner of their ancestors. Our Chiefs were unable
to contend at that time, and, therefore, they sold the lands up
to the line which was then shown to them as the line of that
State. What the commissioners had said about the land having
been ceded to them at the peace, our Chiefs considered as
intended only to lessen the price, and they passed it by with
very little notice; but since that we have heard so much from
others, about the right to our lands, which the King gave when
you made peace with him, that it is our earnest desire that you
will tell us what it means.</p>

<p>Father! Our nation empowered <span class="smcap">John Livingston</span> to let out
part of our lands on rent, to be paid to us. He told us that he
was sent by Congress to do this for us, and we fear he has deceived
us in the writing he has obtained from us. For since
the time of our giving that power, a man of the name of <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>
has come among us, and claimed our whole country, northward
of the line of Pennsylvania, under purchase from that <span class="smcap">Livingston</span>,
to whom he said he had paid twenty thousand dollars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"> 93 </a></span>
for it. He said, also, that he had bought, likewise, from
the Council of the Thirteen Fires, and paid them twenty thousand
dollars more for the same. And he said, also, that it did
not belong to us, for the great King had ceded the whole of it
when you made peace with him. Thus he claimed the whole
country north of Pennsylvania, and west of the lands belonging
to the Cayugas. He demanded it; he insisted on his demand,
and declared that he would have it <i>all</i>. It was impossible for
us to grant him this, and we immediately refused it. After
some days, he proposed to run a line at a small distance east-ward
of our western boundary, which we refused to agree to.
He then threatened us with immediate war if we did not comply.</p>

<p>Upon this threat, our Chiefs held a council, and they agreed
that no event of war could be worse than to be driven, with
our wives and children, from the only country which we had
any right to, and, therefore, weak as our nation was, they determined
to take the chance of war, rather than submit to such
unjust demands, which seemed to have no bounds. <span class="smcap">Street</span>,
the great trader to Niagara, was then with us, having come at
the request of <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>, and as he always professed to be our
great friend, we consulted him upon this subject. He also told
us that our lands had been ceded by the King, and that we
must give them up.</p>

<p>Astonished at what we heard from every quarter, with hearts
aching with compassion for our women and children, we were
thus compelled to give up all our country north of the line of
Pennsylvania, and east of the Genesee river, up to the fork, and
east of a south line drawn from that fork to the Pennsylvania
line.</p>

<p>For this land, <span class="smcap">Phelps</span> agreed to pay us ten thousand dollars
in hand, and one thousand forever. He paid us two thousand
dollars, and five hundred dollars in hand, part of the ten thousand,
and he sent for us to come last spring and receive our
money, but instead of paying us the remainder of the ten thousand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"> 94 </a></span>
and the one thousand dollars due for the first year, he
offered us no more than five hundred dollars, and insisted that
he agreed with us for that sum, to be paid yearly. We debated
with him for six days, during which time he persisted in refusing
to pay us our just demand, and he insisted that we should
receive the five hundred dollars; and <span class="smcap">Street</span>, from Niagara,
also insisted on our receiving the money as it was offered to
us. The last reason he assigned for continuing to refuse paying
was, <i>that the King had ceded all the lands to the Thirteen
Fires</i>, and that he had bought them from you, and <i>paid you
for them</i>.</p>

<p>We could bear this confusion no longer; and determined to
press through every difficulty, and lift up our voice that you
might hear us, and to claim that security in the possession of
our lands, which your commissioners promised us. And we
now entreat you to inquire into our complaints, and redress our
wrongs.</p>

<p>Father! Our writings were lodged in the hands of <span class="smcap">Street</span>,
of Niagara, as we supposed him to be our friend; but when we
saw <span class="smcap">Phelps</span> consulting with <span class="smcap">Street</span>, on every occasion, we
doubted of his honesty towards us, and we have since heard
that he was to receive, for his endeavors to deceive us, a piece
of land ten miles in width, west of the Genesee river, and near
forty miles in length, extending to Lake Ontario; and the lines
of this tract have been run accordingly, although no part of it
is within the bounds which limits his purchase. No doubt he
meant to deceive us.</p>

<p>Father! You have said that we are in your hand, and that
by closing it you could crush us to nothing. Are you determined
to crush us? If you are, tell us so; that those of our
nation who have become your children, and have determined
to die so, may know what to do.</p>

<p>In this case, one Chief has said he would ask you to put him
out of pain. Another, who will not think of dying by the hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"> 95 </a></span>
of his father or his brother, has said he will retire to the Chatauque,
eat of the fatal root, and sleep with his fathers in peace.</p>

<p>Before you determine on a measure so unjust, look up to God,
who has made <i>us</i> as well as <i>you</i>. We hope he will not permit
you to destroy the whole of our nations.</p>

<p>Father! Hear our case; many nations inhabited this country,
but they had no wisdom, and therefore they warred together.
The Six Nations were powerful, and compelled them
to peace; the lands, for a great extent, were given up to them,
but the nations which were not destroyed, all continued on
those lands, and claimed the protection of the Six Nations, as
the brothers of their fathers. They were men, and when at
peace, had a right to live on the earth. The French came
among us and built Niagara; they became our fathers, and
took care of us. Sir <span class="smcap">William Johnson</span> came and took that
Fort from the French; he became our father, and promised to
take care of us, and did so, until you were too strong for his
King. To him we gave four miles around Niagara, as a place
of trade. We have already said how we came to join against
you; we saw that we were wrong; we wished for peace; you
demanded a great country to be given up to you; it was surrendered
to you, as the price of peace, and we ought to have
peace, and possession of the little land which you then left us.</p>

<p>Father! When that great country was given up, there were
but few Chiefs present, and they were compelled to give it up,
and it is not the Six Nations, only, that reproach these Chiefs
with having given up that county, the Chippewas, and all the
nations who lived on those lands westward, call to us, and ask
us "Brothers of our fathers, where is the place you have reserved
for us to lie down upon?"</p>

<p>Father! You have compelled us to do that which has made
us ashamed. We have nothing to answer to the children of
the brothers of our fathers. When, last spring, they called
upon us to go to war to secure them a bed to lie upon, the
Senecas entreated them to be quiet, till we had spoken to you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"> 96 </a></span>
But on our way down, we heard that your army had gone toward
the country which those nations inhabit, and if they meet
together, the best blood on both sides will stain the ground.</p>

<p>Father! We will not conceal from you that the Great God
and not man has preserved <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span> from the hands
of his own nation. For they ask continually "where is the
land which our children, and their children after them, are to
lie down upon." You to us say, that the line drawn from Pennsylvania
to Lake Ontario would mark it forever on the east,
and the line running from Buffalo creek to Pennsylvania would
mark It on the west, and we see that it is not so. For first one,
and then another, comes and takes it away by order of that
people which you tell us promises to secure it to us. He is
silent, for he has nothing to answer. When the sun goes down,
he opens his heart before God, and earlier than that sun appears
upon the hills he gives thanks for his protection during
the night; for he feels that among men, become desperate by
their danger, it is God only that can preserve him. He loves
peace, and all that he had in store he has given to those who
have been robbed by your people lest they should plunder the
innocent to re-pay themselves. The whole season which others
have employed in providing for their families, he has spent in
his endeavors to preserve peace; at this moment his wife and
children are lying on the ground, and in want of food; his
heart is in pain for them, but he perceives that the Great God
will try his firmness in doing what is right.</p>

<p>Father! The game which the Great Spirit sent into our country
for us to eat is going from among us. We thought that he
intended we should till the ground with the plough, as the
white people do, and we talked to one another about it. But
before we speak to you concerning this, we must know from
you, whether you mean to leave us and our children any land
to till. Speak plainly to us concerning this great business.</p>

<p>All the lands we have been speaking of belonged to the Six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"> 97 </a></span>
Nations, and no part of it ever belonged to the King of England,
and he could not give it to you.</p>

<p>The land we live on, our fathers received from God, and they
transmitted it to us for our children, and we cannot part with it.</p>

<p>Father! We told you that we would open our hearts to you.
Hear us once more.</p>

<p>At Fort Stanwix, we agreed to deliver up those of our people
who should do you any wrong, that you might try them,
and punish them according to your law. We delivered up two
men accordingly, but instead of trying them according to your
laws, the lowest of your people took them from your magistrate
and put them immediately to death. It is just to punish
murder with death; but the Senecas will not deliver up their
people to men who disregard the treaties of their own nation.</p>

<p>Father! Innocent men of our nation are killed one after
another, and our best families; but none of your people who
have committed the murders have been punished.</p>

<p>We recollect that you did not promise to punish those who
killed our people, and we now ask, was it intended that your
people should kill the Senecas, and not only remain unpunished
by you, but be protected by you against the revenge of the
next of kin?</p>

<p>Father! These are to us very great things. We know that
you are very strong, and we have heard that you are wise, and
we wait to hear your answer to what we said, that we may
know that you are just.</p>

<h2>ADDRESS</h2>

<p class="center">OF</p>

<p class="caption3 pmb2">PRESIDENT WASHINGTON TO CORNPLANTER, DEC. 29, 1790.</p>


<p class="hanging"><i>The reply of the President of the United States, to the Speech of</i>
<span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>, <span class="smcap">Half-Town</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Great Tree</span>, <i>Chiefs
and Counsellors of the Seneka Nations of Indians</i>.</p>

<p>I, the President of the United States, by my own mouth,
and by a written Speech, signed by own hand and sealed with
the seal of the United States, speak to the Seneka nation, and
desire their attention, and that they would keep this Speech
in remembrance of the friendship of the United States.</p>

<p>I have received your Speech with satisfaction, as a proof of
your confidence in the justice of the United States&mdash;and I have
attentively examined the several objects which you have laid
before me, whether delivered by your Chiefs at Tioga Point,
in the last month, to Colonel <span class="smcap">Pickering</span>, or laid before me, in
the present month, by <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>, and the other
Seneka Chiefs, now in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In the first place, I observe to you, and I request it may sink
deep in your minds, that it is my desire, and the desire of the
United States, that all the miseries of the late war should be
forgotten and buried forever. That in future the United States
and the Six Nations should be truly brothers, promoting each
other's prosperity by acts of mutual friendship and justice.</p>

<p>I am not uninformed that the Six Nations have been led into
some difficulties with respect to the sale of their lands since
the peace. But I must inform you that these evils arose before
the present government of the United States was established,
when the separate States and individuals under their authority,
undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the
sale of their lands.</p>

<p>But the case is now entirely altered&mdash;the general government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"> 99 </a></span>
only has the power to treat with the Indian nations, and
any treaty formed and held without its authority, will not be
binding.</p>

<p>Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands.&mdash;No
State, nor person, can purchase your lands, unless at some
public treaty held under the authority of the United States.
The general government will never consent to your being defrauded.
But it will protect you in all your rights.</p>

<p>Hear well and let it be heard by every person in your nation,
that the President of the United States declares, that the
general government considers itself bound to protect you in all
the lands secured you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the
twenty-second of October, one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-four, excepting such parts as you may since have fairly
sold to persons properly authorized to purchase of you.</p>

<p>You complain that <span class="smcap">John Livingston</span> and <span class="smcap">Oliver Phelps</span>
have obtained your lands, assisted by Mr. <span class="smcap">Street</span>, of Niagara,
and they have not complied with their agreement.</p>

<p>It appears, upon inquiry of the Governor of New York, that
<span class="smcap">John Livingston</span> is not legally authorized to treat with you,
and that every thing he did with you has been declared null
and void, so that you may rest easy on that account.</p>

<p>But it does not appear from any proofs yet in the possession
of government, that <span class="smcap">Oliver Phelps</span> has defrauded you.</p>

<p>If, however, you should have any just cause of complaint
against him, and can make satisfactory proof hereof, the Federal
Courts will be open to you for redress, as to all other persons.</p>

<p>But your great object seems to be the security of your remaining
lands, and I have, therefore, upon this point, meant
to be sufficiently strong and clear.</p>

<p>That in future you cannot be defrauded of your lands.&mdash;That
you possess the right to sell, and the right of refusing to sell
your lands.</p>

<p>That, therefore, the sale of your lands, in future, will depend
entirely upon yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"> 100 </a></span></p>

<p>But that when you may find it for your interest to sell any
parts of your lands, the United States must be present by their
agent, and will be your security, that you shall not be defrauded
in the bargain you may make.</p>

<p>It will, however, be important that before you make any
farther sales of your land, that you should determine among
yourselves who are the persons among you that shall give such
conveyances thereof as shall be binding upon your nation, and
forever preclude all disputes relative to the validity of the sale.</p>

<p>That, besides the before-mentioned security for your land,
you will perceive by the law of Congress for regulating trade
and intercourse with the Indian tribes&mdash;the fatherly care the
United States intend to take of the Indians. For the particular
meaning of this law I refer you to the explanations given
thereof by Colonel <span class="smcap">Pickering</span>, at Tioga, which, with the law,
are herewith delivered to you.</p>

<p>You have said in your Speech, "That the game is going
away from among you, and that you thought it the design of
the Great Spirit that you till the ground;&mdash;but before you speak
upon this subject, you want to know whether the United States
means to leave you any land to till?"</p>

<p>You now know that the lands secured to you by the Treaty
of Fort Stanwix, excepting such parts as you may since have
fairly sold, are yours, and that only your own acts can convey
them away. Speak, therefore, your wishes on the subject of
tilling the ground. The United States will be happy to afford
you every assistance in the only business which will add to
your numbers and happiness.</p>

<p>The murders which have been committed upon some of your
people by the bad white men, I sincerely lament and reprobate,
and I earnestly hope that the real murderers will be secured,
and punished as they deserve. This business has been sufficiently
explained to you here, by the Governor of Pennsylvania,
and by Colonel <span class="smcap">Pickering</span>, on behalf of the United States,
at Tioga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"> 101 </a></span></p>

<p>The Senekas may be assured, that the rewards offered for
apprehending the murderers will be continued until they are
secured for trial, and that when they shall be apprehended, that
they will be tried and punished as if they had killed white men.</p>

<p>Having answered the most material parts of your Speech, I
shall inform you, that some bad Indians, and the outcast of
several tribes who reside at the Miamee Village, have long
continued their murders and depredations upon the frontiers
lying along the Ohio. That they have not only refused to listen
to my voice inviting them to peace, but that upon receiving
it they renewed their incursions and murders with greater violence
than ever. I have, therefore, been obliged to strike those
bad people, in order to make them sensible of their madness.
I sincerely hope they will hearken to reason, and not require
to be further chastised. The United States desire to be the
friends of the Indians, upon terms of justice and humanity.&mdash;But
they will not suffer the depredations of the bad Indians to
go unpunished.</p>

<p>My desire is that you would caution all the Senekas and Six
Nations, to prevent their rash young men from joining the
Miamee Indians.&mdash;For the United States cannot distinguish
the tribes to which bad Indians belong, and every tribe must
take care of their own people.</p>

<p>The merits of <span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span>, and his friendship for
the United States, are well known to me, and shall not be forgotten,
and as a mark of the esteem of the United States, I
have directed the Secretary of War to make him a present of
two hundred and fifty dollars, either in money or goods, as
<span class="smcap">The Cornplanter</span> shall Like best&mdash;and he may depend upon
the future continued kindness of the United States;&mdash;and I
have also directed the Secretary of War to make suitable presents
to the other Chiefs present in Philadelphia;&mdash;and also,
that some further tokens of friendship to be forwarded to the
other Chiefs, now in their nation.</p>

<p>Remember my words, Senekas&mdash;continue to be strong in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"> 102 </a></span>
your friendship for the United States, as the only rational
ground of your future happiness, and you may rely upon their
kindness and protection.</p>

<p>An agent shall soon be appointed to reside in some place
convenient to the Senekas and Six Nations. He will represent
the United States. Apply to him on all occasions.</p>

<p>If any man brings you evil reports of the intentions of the
United States, mark that man as your enemy, for he will mean
to deceive you and lead you into trouble. The United States
will be true and faithful to their engagements.</p>

<h2>SPEECH OF CORNPLANTER,</h2>

<p class="caption3 pmb2">IN REPLY TO PRESIDENT WASHINGTON'S ADDRESS.</p>


<p>Father:&mdash;Your speech, written on the great paper, is to us
like the first light of the morning to a sick man, whose pulse
beats too strongly in his temples and prevents him from sleep.
He sees it and rejoices, but is not cured. You say that you
have spoken plainly on the great point. That you will protect
us in the lands secured to us at Fort Stanwix, and that we have
the right to <i>sell</i>, or to <i>refuse</i> to sell it. This is very good. But
our nation complain that you compelled us at that treaty to
give up too much of our lands. We confess that our nation
is bound by what was there done; and acknowledging your
power, we have now appealed to yourselves against that treaty,
as made while you were too angry at us, and therefore unreasonable
and unjust. To this you have given us no answer.</p>

<p>Father! That treaty was not made with a single State&mdash;it
was with the Thirteen States. We never would have given all
that land to one State. We know it was before you had the
great authority, and as you have more wisdom than the commissioners
who forced us into that treaty, we expect that you
have also more regard to justice, and will now, at our request,
re-consider that treaty, and restore to us a part of that land.</p>

<p>Father! The land which lies between the line running south
from Lake Erie to the boundary of Pennsylvania, as mentioned
at the treaty at Fort Stanwix, and the eastern boundary of the
land which you sold, and the Senecas confirmed to Pennsylvania,
is the land in which Half Town and all his people live,
with other Chiefs who always have been and still are dissatisfied
with the treaty at Fort Stanwix. They grew out of this
land, and their fathers grew out of it, and they cannot be persuaded
to part with it. We, therefore, entreat you to restore
to us this little piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"> 104 </a></span></p>

<p>Father! Look at the land which we gave to you at that treaty,
and then turn your eyes upon what we now ask you to restore
to us, and you will see that what we ask you to return <i>is
a very little piece</i>. By giving it back again you will satisfy the
whole of our nation. The Chiefs who signed that treaty will
be in safety, and peace between your children and our children
will continue so long as your land shall join ours. Every man
of our nation will then turn their eyes away from all the other
lands which we then gave up to you, and forget that our fathers
ever said that they belonged, to them.</p>

<p>Father! We see that you ought to have the path at the carrying-place
from Lake Erie to Niagara, as it was marked down
at Fort Stanwix, and we are all willing, that it should remain
to be yours. And if you desire to reserve a passage through;
the Conewango, and through the Chatauque lake, and land for
a path from that lake to Lake Erie, take it where you best like.
Our nation will rejoice to see it an open path for you and your
children while the land and water remain. But let us also pass
along the same way and continue to take the fish of those waters
in common with you.</p>

<p>Father! You say that you will appoint an agent to take care
of us. Let him come and take care of our trade; but we desire
he may not have any thing to do with our lands; for the
agents which have come among us, and pretended to take care
of us, have always deceived us whenever we sold lands; both
when the King, of England and the States have bargained with
us. They have by this means occasioned many wars, and we
are, therefore, unwilling to trust them again.</p>


<p>Father! When we return home we will call a Great Council,
and consider well how lands may be hereafter sold by our nation.
And when we have agreed upon it, we will send you
notice of it. But we desire that you will not depend on your
agent for information concerning land; for after the abuses,
which we have suffered by such men, we will not trust them
with any thing which relates to land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"> 105 </a></span></p>

<p>Father! There are men that go from town to town and beget
children, and leave them to perish, or, except better men take
care of them, to grow up without instruction. Our nation has
looked round for a father, but they found none that would own
them for children, until you now tell us that your courts are
open to us as to your own people. The joy which we feel at
this great news so mixes with the sorrows that are past, that
we cannot express our gladness, nor conceal the remembrance
of our afflictions. We will speak of them at another time.</p>

<p>Father! We are ashamed that we have listened to the lies
of <span class="smcap">Livingston</span>, or been influenced by the threats of war by
<span class="smcap">Phelps</span>, and would hide that whole transaction from the
world, and from ourselves, by quietly receiving what <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>;
promised to give us for the lands they cheated us of. But as
<span class="smcap">Phelps</span> will not pay us even according to that fraudulent bargain,
we will lay the whole proceedings before your court.
When the evidence which we can produce is heard, we think
it will appear that the whole bargain was founded on lies which
he placed one upon another; that the goods that he charges
to us as part payment were plundered from us; that if <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>
was not directly concerned in the theft, he knew of it at the
time and concealed it from us, and that the persons that we
confided in were bribed by him to deceive us in the bargain,
and if these facts appear, that your court will not say that
such bargains are just, but will set the whole aside.</p>

<p>Father! We apprehend that our evidence might be called
for as <span class="smcap">Phelps</span> was here, and knew what we have said concerning
him; and as <span class="smcap">Ebenezer Allen</span> knew something of
the matter, we desired him to continue here. <span class="smcap">Nicholson</span>, the
interpreter, is very sick, and we request that <span class="smcap">Allen</span> may remain
a few days longer, as he speaks our language.</p>

<p>Father! The blood which was spilled near Pine creek is
covered, and we shall never look where it lies. We know that
Pennsylvania will satisfy us for that which we spoke of to them
before we spoke to you. The chain of Friendship will now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"> 106 </a></span>
we hope, be made strong as you desire it to be. We will hold
it last, and our end of it shall never rust in our hands.</p>

<p>Father! We told you what advice we gave the people you are
now at war with, and we now tell you, that they have promised
to come again to our towns next spring. We shall not wait
for their coming, but will set out very early and show to them
what you have done <i>for</i> us, which must convince them that you
will do for them every thing which they ought to ask. We
think they will hear and follow our advice.</p>

<p>Father! You give us leave to speak our minds concerning
the tilling of the ground. We ask you to teach us to plough,
and to grind corn; to assist us in building saw mills, and to
supply us with broad axes, saws, augers, and other tools, so
as that we make our houses more comfortable and more durable;
that you will send smiths among us, and above all, that
you will teach our children to read and write, and our women
to spin and to weave. The manner of your doing these things
for us we leave to you, who understand them; but we assure
you we will follow your advice as far as we are able.</p>

<h2>SPEECH</h2>

<p class="center">OF</p>

<p class="caption3">CORNPLANTER, HALF TOWN, AND BIG TREE, SENECA CHIEFS,</p>

<p class="caption4 pmb2">ON TAKING LEAVE OF PRESIDENT WASHINGTON.</p>


<p>Father! No Seneca ever goes from the fire of his friend until
he has said to him, "I am going." We, therefore, tell you,
that we are now setting out for our own country.</p>

<p>Father! We thank you from our hearts, that we now know
there is a country we may call our own, and on which we may
lay down in peace. We see that there will be peace between
your children and our children, and our hearts are very glad.
We will persuade the Wyandotts, and other western nations,
to open their eyes and look towards the bed which you have
made for us, and to ask of you a bed for themselves and their
children, that will not slide from under them. We thank you
for your presents to us, and rely on your promise to instruct us
in raising corn, as the white people do; the sooner you do this
the better for us. And we thank you for the care you have
taken to prevent bad men from coming to trade among us. If
any come without your license we will turn them back; and we
hope our nation will determine to spill all the rum which shall
hereafter be brought to our towns.</p>

<p>Father! We are glad to hear that you determine to appoint
an agent that will do us justice in taking care that bad men do
not come to trade among us; but we earnestly entreat you that
you will let us have an interpreter, in whom we can confide, to
reside at Pittsburg. To that place our people, and other nations,
will long continue to resort. There we must send what
news we hear, when we go among the western nations, which
we are determined shall be early in the spring. We know
<span class="smcap">Joseph Nicholson</span>, and he speaks our language so that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"> 108 </a></span>
clearly understand what you say to us, and we rely on what
he says. If we were able to pay him for his services we would
do it, but when we meant to pay him, by giving him land, it
has not been confirmed to him; and he will not serve us any
longer, unless you will pay him. Let him stand between us
we entreat you.</p>

<p>Father! You have not asked any security for peace on our
part, but we have agreed to send you nine Seneca boys to be
under your care for education. Tell us at what time you will receive
them, and they shall be sent at the time you shall appoint.
This will assure you that we are indeed at peace with you, and
determined to continue so. If you can teach them to become
wise and good men, we will take care that our nation shall be
willing to receive instruction from them.</p>

<h2>SPEECH OF CORNPLANTER,</h2>

<p class="center pmb2">TO PRESIDENT WASHINGTON, PHILADELPHIA, FEBRUARY 28, 1797.</p>


<p>Father! I thank the Great Spirit for protecting us through
the various paths which we have trod since I was last at this
place. As I am told you are about to retire from public business,
I have come to pay my last address to you as the Great
Chief of the Fifteen Fires, and am happy to find that I have
arrived here in time to address you once more as father, and
to advise with you on the business of our nation. You have
always told us that the land which we live upon is our own
and that we may make such use of it as we think most conducive
to our own comfort, and the happiness of posterity.</p>

<p>Father! I wish, whilst I am able to do business, to provide
for the rising generation. Our forefathers thought that their
posterity would pursue their tracks, and support themselves
by their hunts, as they did in the extensive forests given them
by the Great Spirit, and by them transmitted to us. But the
great revolution among the white people in this country has
extended its influence to the people of my color. Turn our faces
which way we will, we find the white people cultivating the
ground which our forefathers hunted over, and the forests
which furnished them with plenty, now afford but a scanty
subsistence for us, and our young men are not safe in pursuing
it. If a few years have made such a change, what will be the
situation of our children when those calamities increase?</p>

<p>Father! To those points I wish to draw your attention, and
once more to have your candid and friendly advice on what will
be the best for the present race, and how we can best provide
for posterity. Your people have a different mode of living from
ours; they have trades and they have education, which enables
them to take different pursuits, by which means they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"> 110 </a></span>
maintain themselves, provide for their children and help each
other.</p>

<p>Father! I am also told that your people have a strong place
for their money, where it is not only safe, but that it produces
them each and every year an increase without lessening the
stock. If we should dispose of part of our country and put
our money with your's in that strong place, will it be safe?
Will it yield to our children the same advantages after our
heads are laid down as it will at present produce to us? Will
it be out of the reach of our foolish young men, so that they
cannot drink it up to the prejudice of our children?</p>

<p>Father! You know that some of our people are fond of strong
drink, and I am sorry to observe that your people are too apt
to lay that temptation before them.</p>

<p>Father! The last time I was here I mentioned to you that
my mind was uneasy in regard to Mr. <span class="smcap">Oliver Phelps's</span> purchase,
to which you desired me to make my mind easy, and
said that you would inquire into the business. On my return
I met Mr. <span class="smcap">Phelps</span> at Canandaigua, where he promised to give
me a piece of land and to build me a house, and give me some
cattle. With this I was satisfied, till I saw him again sometime
after, when he, to my surprise, had almost forgotten it;
but when I put him in mind of it, he gave me a horse and ten
cattle, but refused the house and land because land had raised
so much in value.</p>

<p>Father! To one thing more I wish your attention. When I
was returning home the last time I was here, I was plundered
by some of your unruly people of several things, amongst
which was a paper, given me by General <span class="smcap">Parsons</span>, entitling
me to one mile square of land at Muskingum, which I have
never been able to recover, and without your friendly assistance
must lose the land.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[AD]</span></a> This is the land granted by the Ohio company referred to in Colonel
<span class="smcap">Snowden's</span> Historical Sketch. It thus appears that <span class="smcap">Cornplanter's</span> title
papers for this land were stolen from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"> 111 </a></span></p></div>

<p>Father! I congratulate you on your intended repose from
the fatigues and anxiety of mind which are constant attendants
on high public stations, and hope that the same good
Spirit which has so long guided your steps as a father to a
great nation, will still continue to protect you, and make your
private reflections as pleasant to yourself as your public measures
have been useful to your people.</p>

<h2>SPEECH OF CORNPLANTER,</h2>

<p class="center pmb2">TO THE GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA, FEBRUARY, 1822.</p>


<p>I feel it my duty to send a speech to the Governor of Pennsylvania
at this time, and inform him of the place where I was
from, which was at Connewaugus, on the Genessee river.</p>

<p>When I was a child I played with the butterfly, the grasshopper
and the frogs; and as I grew up, I began to pay some
attention, and play with the Indian boys in the neighborhood,
and they took notice of my skin being of a different color from
theirs, and spoke about it. I inquired of my mother the cause,
and she told me that my father was a residenter in Albany. I
still eat my victuals out of a bark dish. I grew up to be a
young man, and married me a wife, and I had no kettle nor
gun. I then knew where my father lived, and went to see him,
and found he was a white man, and spoke the English language.
He gave me victuals while I was at his house, but
when I started home, he gave me no provision to eat on the
way. He gave me neither kettle nor gun, neither did he tell
me that the United States were about to rebel against the government
of England.</p>

<p>I will tell you, brothers, who are in session of the Legislature
of Pennsylvania, that the Great Spirit has made known
to me, that I have been wicked; and the cause thereof has
been the Revolutionary war in America. The cause of the Indians
being led into sin at that time, was that many of them
were in the practice of drinking and getting intoxicated. Great
Britain requested us to join with them in the conflict against
the Americans, and promised the Indians land and liquor. I
myself was opposed to joining in the conflict, as I had nothing
to do with the difficulty that existed between the two parties.
I have now informed you how it happened that the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"> 113 </a></span>
took a part in the Revolution, and will relate to you some circumstances
that occurred after the close of the war.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>, who was then at Philadelphia, told me
there was to be a Council at Fort Stanwix; and the Indians
requested me to attend on behalf of the Six Nations, which I
did, and there met with three commissioners who had been appointed
to hold the Council. They told me that they would
inform me of the cause of the Revolution, which I requested
them to do minutely. They then said that it originated on
account of the heavy taxes, that had been imposed upon them
by the British government, which had been for fifty years increasing
upon them; that the Americans had grown weary
thereof, and refused to pay, which affronted the King. There
had likewise a difficulty taken place about some tea, which
they wished me not to use, as it had been one of the causes
that many people had lost their lives. And the British government
now being affronted, the war commenced, and the
cannons began to roar in our country.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Putnam</span> then told me at the Council at Fort Stanwix,
that by the late war, the Americans had gained two objects:
they had established themselves an independent nation,
and had obtained some land to live upon, <i>the division line of
which from Great Britain run through the Lakes</i>. I then spoke,
and said I wanted some land for the Indians to live on, and
General <span class="smcap">Putnam</span> said that it should be granted, and I should
have land in the State of New York for the Indians. He then
encouraged me to use my endeavors to pacify the Indians generally,
and as he considered it an arduous task, wished to
know what pay I would require. I replied, that I would use
my endeavors to do as he requested with the Indians, and for
pay therefore, <i>I would take land</i>. <i>I told him not to pay me money
or dry-goods, but land.</i> And having attended thereto, I
received the tract of land on which I now live, which was presented
to me by Governor <span class="smcap">Mifflin</span>. I told General <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>
that I wished the Indians to have the exclusive privilege of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"> 114 </a></span>
the deer and wild game, to which he assented. I also wished
the Indians to have the privilege of hunting in the woods and
making fires, which he likewise assented to.</p>

<p>The treaty that was made at the aforementioned Council,
has been broken by some of the white people, which I now intend
acquainting the Governor with. Some white people are
not willing that the Indians should hunt any more, whilst
others are satisfied therewith; and those white people who reside
near our reservation, tell us that the woods are theirs,
and they have obtained them from the government. The treaty
has also been broken, by the white people using their endeavors
to destroy all wolves, which was not spoken about in the
Council at Fort Stanwix, by General <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>, but has originated
lately.</p>

<p>It has been broken again, which is of recent origin. White
people get credit from Indians, and do not pay them honestly
according to agreement. In another respect, also, it has been
broken by white people residing near my dwelling; for when
I plant melons and vines in my field, they take them as their
own. It has been broken again, by white people using their
endeavors to obtain our pine trees from us. We have very
few pine trees on our land in the State of New York, and whites
and Indians often get into dispute respecting them. There is
also a great quantity of whiskey brought near our reservation,
and the Indians obtain it and become drunken.</p>

<p>Another circumstance has taken place which is very trying,
to me, and I wish for the interference of the Governor. The
white people who live at Warren, called upon me some time
ago, to pay taxes for my land, which I objected to, as I never
had been called upon for that purpose before; and having refused
to pay, they became irritated, called upon me frequently,
and at length brought four guns with them, and seized our
cattle. I still refused to pay, and was not willing to let the
cattle go. After a time of dispute, they returned home, and I
understood the militia was ordered out to enforce the collection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"> 115 </a></span>
of the tax. I went to Warren, and to avert the impending
difficulty, was obliged to give my note for the tax, the
amount of which was forty-three dollars and seventy-nine cents.
It is my desire that the Governor will exempt me from paying
taxes for my land to white people; and also to cause that the
money I am now obliged to pay, be refunded to me, as I am
very poor. The Governor is the person who attends to the
situation of the people, and I wish him to send a person to Allegheny,
that I may inform him of the particulars of our situation,
and he be authorized to instruct the white people in what
manner to conduct themselves towards the Indians.</p>

<p>The government has told us, that when difficulties arose between
the Indians and the white people, they would attend to
having them removed. We are now in a trying situation, and
I wish the Governor to send a person authorized to attend
thereto the forepart of next summer, about the time that the
grass has grown big enough for pasture.</p>

<p>The Governor formerly requested me to pay attention to the
Indians, and take care of them. We are now arrived at a
situation in which I believe the Indians cannot exist, unless
the Governor should comply with my request, and send a person
authorized to treat between us and the white people the
approaching summer. I have now no more to speak.</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
